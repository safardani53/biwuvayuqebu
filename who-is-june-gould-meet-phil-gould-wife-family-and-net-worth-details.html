Phil Gould’s makeover was recently noticed by NRL fans and analysts when he appeared at Channel 9’s NRL season introduction. Gould, often known as Phillip Ronald Gould or “Gus,” is a well-known Australian rugby league commentator, journalist, and administrator.</p><p>Phil was a professional player and coach in the past. Gould is the NRL general manager of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. The Canterbury Bulldogs football team manager looks slim and athletic as he addressed the platform to answer questions about the forthcoming season from presenter James Bracey.&nbsp;Since joining the Bulldogs in 2021 after leaving the Warriors, the announcer has lost more than 10 kg. According to reports, Gould’s weight reduction is the consequence of greater activity and dietary knowledge. Fans have become used to the new, thinner TV analyst, and the NRL specialist is in the finest shape he has been in years.</p><h2>Phil Gould’s Wife, June Gould, and Their Children</h2><p><strong>June Gould’s</strong> life has evolved as Phil Gould’s wife. While looking for the journalist, many admirers and individuals sought his wife. The pundit is content in his relationship with June. They married in the year 2000. The pair has been married for more than 20 years, and their relationship seems to be based on honesty, faith, and unconditional love.</p><p>There have been no reports in the media about Phil Gould’s wife or their marriage. Phil is a loyal partner as well as a caring father to his three children. Unfortunately, there isn’t much information available on the internet about Phil Gould’s wife. Phil may one day share the limelight with his wife and children.&nbsp;In January 1958, the administrator was born to his parents in Sydney, New South Wales. Phil has kept his life private, refusing to share his parents or other information.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Phil-Gould-1.jpg alt="Phil Gould" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Gould must have had loving and supportive parents who helped him get to this position in his profession. The parents of the commentators must be overjoyed to watch their son on television commentating on sports.&nbsp;According to the Daily Mail, Phil Gould noted that Mario Fenech’s dementia struggle served as a melancholy reminder of his late father’s battle with the ailment. Gould’s father died eight years after being diagnosed with dementia.</p><h2>Phil Gould’s Net Worth</h2><p>Phil Gould’s net worth is $900,000, according to Net Worth Post.&nbsp;The broadcaster has amassed a sizable fortune as a rugby league journalist, former player, and coach.&nbsp;Unfortunately, Gould has not made his current pay and contract information public, which would have provided a comprehensive picture of his earnings.&nbsp;Gould is now a subject matter expert for rugby league telecasts on Channel 9 and Triple M radio, covering the NRL, State of Origin, and international football fixtures.</p><p>In addition, he co-hosts “Six Tackles with Gus,” a weekly podcast with Mathew Thompson. He is a writer for the Sydney Morning Herald. In the 2014 Queen’s Birthday Honours List, Phil was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for his considerable contribution to rugby league football as an administrator, commentator, coach, and player, as well as to the community.&nbsp;Gould was named Panthers captain at the age of 20, establishing history in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Phil-Gould-2.jpg alt="Phil Gould" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The former athlete represented four teams and participated in the top division 103 times. Because of his resemblance to Mr. Squiggle, the moniker “Gus” was given due to post-retirement weight gain.&nbsp;Phil had a successful coaching career after retiring. His first five coaching seasons yielded two titles.&nbsp;From 2002 to 2004, he coached New South Wales in the State of Origin series, winning two and drawing the other. He has had the greatest success of any coach in New South Wales to date.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsButtSnnGafn6q5pXnMnpytZaCdtq15xqispZxdrLansYyfmKahnK56orrDZqWerF2svLPAx2abnqyRnrm0ew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./billie-eilish-leather-dress-met-gala-after-party-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Billie Eilish Leather Dress At Met Gala After-Party 2021  Photos  Hollywood Life">&larr;
