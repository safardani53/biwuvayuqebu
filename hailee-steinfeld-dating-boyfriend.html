She will also be voicing the role of Gwen Stacy once again in the animated movie <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man</a>: Across the Spider-Verse – Part One (2022).</p><p>With all the professional success that the American actress has been gaining, her fans worldwide are left to wonder if there is anyone in her life with whom she shares her success.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Hailee Steinfeld gay?</h2><p>Before we dive into who Steinfeld is currently dating and her dating history, let’s have a look at another query related to her that has been asked quite frequently by the fans. And the query is, “Is Hailee Steinfeld gay?”</p><p>People have been speculating for a long time about the actress’s sexuality and wondering if she is gay. These gay rumors started after she portrayed the role of a lesbian poet named Emily Dickinson in the hit comedy-drama Dickinson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hailee-steinfeld-dickinson.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Hailee Steinfeld as Emily Dickinson in ‘Dickinson’ (Photo: Polygon)</p><p>In the show, Steinfeld’s performance as an LGBTQ character and on-screen romance with actress Ella Hunt’s character, Sue, was very much compelling, so much so that fans were left wondering if Steinfeld was gay/lesbian in real life as well.</p><p>And since then, netizens on social media have frequently asked if she is gay. For instance, one Twitter user wrote in November 2021, “wait, is Hailee Steinfeld gay??” with another adding, “Hailee Steinfeld is gay, right… like just a little bit??? Pls.”</p><p>Similarly, in August 2022, another user tweeted, “My toxic trait is wishing that Hailee Steinfeld is queer.”</p><p>The speculations around her sexuality got further fueled when netizens found an old Instagram post made by the part-time singer on October 5, 2015. She had posted a picture of herself performing on stage with the caption, “G-A-Y.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>So, what’s the truth? Is Steinfeld gay/lesbian? Well, the answer to this question remains to be answered. But, until the questions are answered, it’s best to assume her sexuality is straight, considering she has only dated men and been linked to men.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Hailee Steinfeld dating?</h2><p>The present relationship status of the 25-year-old actress is she is reportedly in a romantic relationship with NFL star Josh Allen after his <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/exclusive/josh-allen-girlfriend-break-up/ rel="noreferrer noopener">split with his girlfriend Brittany Williams</a>.</p><p>On Monday, May 29, 2023, a source close to Steinfeld <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://people.com/hailee-steinfeld-has-been-dating-josh-allen-for-a-few-weeks-having-fun-exclusive-7505089 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">exclusively told People</a> that the two have been “hanging out for a few weeks” and that they are a “cute couple.” “It’s new, but they are having fun,” the source added.</p><p>The source’s claims came after Steinfeld and Allen were first seen together on Thursday, May 25, in New York City. Days later, on Saturday, May 27, the two were again spotted together, which has been reported by multiple outlets as a double date.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hailee-steinfeld-reported-boyfriend-josh-allen.webp><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Hailee Steinfeld with her reported boyfriend Josh Allen (Photo: THEIMAGEDIRECT.COM)</p><p>As of now, neither Steinfeld nor Allen or their respective reps have made an official comment about their relationship.</p><p>Before reports of her dating the NFL star arose, she seemed to be single. A private person on her own, Steinfeld hadn’t given any hints of her having a boyfriend in recent times, either on her public outings or via her social media handles.</p><p>It seemed like she was very much occupied with her professional career that she doesn’t have time to focus on building a relationship. Her singleness was also shown when <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a38093330/hailee-steinfeld-hawkeye-dickinson-new-music/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cosmopolitan interviewed her</a> on November 16, 2021.</p><p>During that exclusive interview, she was asked what would be her response to those fans who were dying to know about her dating life. In reply, she stated that she is currently very focused on herself and “couldn’t be happier about it.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>“I have moments where I’m like, ‘All my friends are engaged, married, dating.’ What a wonderful thing that seems like, right? I really don’t ever have moments of, ‘Oh God, I feel so single,’ but it is funny how in the past year or so, a lot of people have gotten engaged or married.”</p><p>In the end, she funnily added, “I’m like, ‘Everybody’s gotta slow down for me, okay?’”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Hailee Steinfeld’s ideal choice of a partner</h2><p>In the same interview with Cosmopolitan, the Bumblebee star mentioned that she is in a place right now where she knows what she wants for herself – in relationships, work, and life in general.</p><p>“So that’s what I’m after. I’m painting the picture of what all that looks like,” she further added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hailee-steinfeld-hawkeye.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Hailee Steinfeld as Kate Bishop in the Disney+ series ‘Hawkeye’ (Photo: STEVE SANDS/SPLASHNEWS.COM)</p><p>Right after that, the interviewer asked her, “What exactly are some of those things you want?” Replying to that, she went on to say that she wants a partner who is, first and foremost, “loyal and honest but confident in themselves and able to do their thing while I do mine.”</p><p>Continuing her statement, she said, “It’s weird talking about it because it’s been in my head for so long. A lot of this music is also about taking control and taking ownership of one’s self. But I also think there’s power in claiming what you want, and maybe what you want is not to be alone.”</p><p>Considering her ideal choice of a partner, whoever ends up with all of those qualities, will be lucky to have Steinfeld in his life and vice-versa.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A look into Hailee Steinfeld’s dating history</h2><p>Although she might be single now, her relationship status wasn’t the same in the past. She was in a couple of relationships with some known personalities.</p><p>Steinfeld’s first reported <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">relationship</a> goes back to 2016 when she began dating an internet personality named Cameron Smoller. In January 2017, they made their red carpet debut as a couple at the 2017 Golden Globes event.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>However, sometime after appearing as a couple, reports surfaced that the two had parted ways. It’s unknown when and why the duo decided to break up.</p><p>Later, in early 2018, rumors surfaced that the actress/singer was in a relationship with the former member of One Direction, Niall Horan. The rumors were high, and it didn’t take much time for Steinfeld to address it. Speaking to <a href=# rel=noopener>US Weekly</a> in January 2018, she said;</p><p>“I feel so lucky that [my fans] care enough about me to know what I’m doing every second of every day, but I think that sometimes it’s hard for people in general to realize that there are boundaries to a person’s life and personal life.”</p><p>Adding more, she stated, “I am a very private person. I do love that I have the opportunity to share with them what I’m comfortable with and they’re there to listen and support me.”</p><p>Despite the actress denying dating Horan, by August 2018, it was evident that the two were dating, especially after pictures of the two sharing a kiss at Disneyland surfaced.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>However, after four months, the couple ended things for good. And although it seemed their split was amicable, Steinfeld’s potential diss to her ex-boyfriend afterward didn’t make it so.</p><p>In January 2019, she went on to repost Julia Michaels’ Instagram story, reading “New Year’s Resolution: no more dating narcissists” with an additional line of her own that read, “God bless you, @juliamichaels. Preach it.”</p><p>The next year, she released a song titled Wrong Direction as a part of her second EP, Half Written Story. Many believed that the song’s title, ‘Wrong Direction,’ was a reference to Horan, who was a former member of One Direction.</p><p>As for her relationships after Horan, it seems like she has been living a single life. Nonetheless, there were talks of her dating Justin Bieber and Douglas Booth. But, all of them were nothing more than rumors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57wJyrq52jqHyprcilnJ5lo6myqrrFnqOdZZSWwaq6xmaZqLGWp7amusNo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./netflix-reality-shows.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="  Melanie Rose hailed as Mary Poppins of sex rooms as she approaches 60    Wed 13 July 2022 17">&larr;
