It's all good."</p><p>About five minutes into the game,&nbsp;Sunny and&nbsp;Alyssa picked the category "Rear View."</p><p>As Whoopi walked over to deliver the card, she turned around and showed her backside to the cameras, shocking her co-hosts.</p><p>Joy&nbsp;also came out from behind her stand and turned around to give Whoopi a glimpse of her "rear view."</p><p>Whoopi flaunted her figure and almost bowed after handing Alyssa the card.</p><p>Joy leaned over her podium and said: "Whoopi giving us a rear view."</p><h2>JOY'S DELIGHT</h2><p>Viewers' jaws were on the floor during the same episode, when&nbsp;Joy Behar&nbsp;made a NSFW comment while playing the game.</p><p>Another one of the categories Michael read was titled "Afternoon Delight."</p><p>That led to Joy instantly joking to Whoopi "That's what she wants," referencing the <a href=#>NSFW alternate meaning</a> behind afternoon delight.</p><p>The embarrassed guest then appeared to snap at Joy over her earlier comments.</p><p>"Joy, this is a family game," he said, half snippy but seemingly half joking also.</p><h2>SHERRI'S SLIP-UP</h2><p>Former co-host Sherri Shepherd returned for a guest stint earlier this year, and picked up right where she left off: <a href=#>shocking fans after making NSFW comments</a>.</p><p>During the live broadcast,&nbsp;<a href=#>Sherri</a>&nbsp;somehow found herself revealing that her 17-year-old son Jeffrey is at the age where he’s just in his “room for hours at a time.”</p><p>Host&nbsp;Joy&nbsp;replied sarcastically: “Gee, I wonder what he’s doing in there.”</p><p>Sherri then added: “Imma tell you this, all the men in my life said just get lotion and put it in his room and back out the door.”</p><p>While some of the hosts were laughing,&nbsp;Ana Navarro&nbsp;blasted her, saying: “Sherri, TMI!”</p><p>The ex-host didn’t stop there, though, and instead turned the NSFW comments on herself.</p><p>After revealing she’s been “celibate for four years,” The 55-year-old admitted she spends a lot of alone time in her room, as well.</p><p>“I gotta lock my door ‘cause– ya know, Kandi Burruss, I order toys from Kandi Burruss all the time. And the problem is, as you get older, you get more tired.</p><p>Sherri explained that she once fell asleep with one of her "toys" still in her hand.</p><p>Her son, Jeffrey, walked in and woke her up, to both of their shocks.</p><p>"So, I’m laying and I go, ‘What are you doing?!’" she continued.</p><p>While sitting in her chair on the show, she mimicked her body jolting all over.</p><p>“The thing was still on."</p><p>Ana had had enough at that point and said it was time to move on because it was “taking a nasty turn.”</p><h2>TOO FAR?</h2><p>It's not always fun and games on the show.</p><p>In July, Whoopi <a href=#>dropped an NSFW word on live TV</a>, and even apologized to her producers on the set.</p><p>Amid a political discussion with her co-hosts, the TV personality mediated the topic by offering a call of action to viewers.</p><p>The comedian pleaded with fans to "get out and vote" to change the representatives who have been causing controversy in office.</p><p>"All this other stuff, all the stuff that's creeping in is frighteningly dangerous to all of us, left, and right," she began.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Whoopi then looked directly at the camera as she continued: "It's going to bite us all in the butt."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The TV star then realized the word might not be fit for viewers, so she turned to producers and asked: "How's that? Butt is okay? Can I say butt?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/image-96.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/image-101.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000743622729.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2htaWiGdXyTaK2inadiurC%2F02alrJ6nYrqwucSnq6xlp528sLzIZp6opJSXsrOzjKucmqpdoba3sYytrWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-jill-hennessy-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Jill Hennessy Dating Now">&larr;
