Travis Kelce is also a professional football player who plays in the NFL for the Kansas City Chiefs.</p><p>Travis serves as a tight end and is the younger brother of Jason. Besides that, both of the brothers are Super Bowl Champions.</p><p>Travis’ brother, Jason Kelce, acquired his Super Bowl ring after defeating the New England Patriots in the 2018 Super Bowl Finals and Travis in the 2020 Super Bowl with the Chiefs defeating the San Francisco 49ers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Untitled-design-50.png><p>Jason was named to the First-team All-Pro five times and Pro Bowl six times.

The pair got divorced in 2011.</p><p>Nevertheless, they maintain a cordial relationship and are often at their sons’ games to support and cheer for them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jason-Kelce-and-Travis-Kelce.jpg><p>The NFL player comes from a very athletic family and his family has always been very supportive of his career choice.</p><p>Donna was a track and field athlete, while her brother served as a defensive tackle at Purdue University. Likewise, her father had a tremendous collegiate football career at Ohio University.</p><p>Besides that, Ed also played high school football and rugby back in his days. As a result, the parents were very keen on signing Jason and <a href=#>Travis</a> into various sports programs.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, the siblings excelled at sports, and the Kelce house started piling up with awards and trophies.</p><h3>Nature</h3><p>Travis Kelce’s brother was laid back and carefree. Once his teammates encouraged him to do a dumpster dive, he immediately agreed, as he never backed away from a challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>The Eagles center dived into the trash can in the middle of the school cafeteria, resulting in a hysterical laugh from students. He got detention for it, but even the vice principal had a good laugh.</p><p>Unlike his brother, Jason often got in trouble at school and was usually suspended for his actions. As per his father, he was suspended at least once per year in elementary school for fighting.&nbsp;</p><h3>Sibling Relationship</h3><p>The Eagles center is two years older than his younger brother, Travis, and they have been very close since the beginning and extremely competitive.&nbsp;</p><p>According to their parents, they were also somehow opposites of each other. While Jason did not care about other people’s opinions, Travis was very concerned about how others perceived him.&nbsp;</p><p>Travis was well dressed, rarely got in trouble at school, and even if he did, he would usually talk his way out of suspension.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Travis-Kelce-and-Jason-Kelce-scaled.jpg><p>The siblings love each other dearly and constantly look out for one another. Travis looks up to his older brother a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>Once, the brothers fight ended up spilling dinner and accidentally knocking their dad down. Ed initially pretended to be hurt so his sons would stop fighting and call a truce.</p><h3>Travis Kelce</h3><p>The Kansas City Chiefs drafted Travis Kelce as the 63 pick overall in the 2013 NFL Draft.</p><p>With the Chiefs, Travis plays as the tight end and has won the 2020 Super Bowl Championship.</p><p>Besides, the footballer has set many records in the league, i.e., the most consecutive and most overall season with 1000-yard receiving by tight end, and the most receiving yards in a season.</p><p>Like his older brother, Travis played in college for the Cincinnati Bearcats. However, in 2010, he was suspended after testing positive for marijuana for the entire season.&nbsp;</p><h3>Education</h3><p>Jason Kelce went to Cleveland Heights High School, where he played football and hockey.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike his brother, he did not have many offers and scholarships from schools despite being very skilled. Hence, following graduation, he decided to enroll at the University of Cincinnati.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Age, Height, And Weight</h2><p>Jason Kelce, the center, was born on November 5, 1987, and is <span>36 years old as of December 2023.

Besides that, the athlete is 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 meters) tall and weighs 134 kg (295 pounds).&nbsp;</p><h2>Football Career</h2><h3>High School And Collegiate Career</h3><p>Kelce started playing high school football for Cleveland Heights High School as both running back and linebacker, and was named All-Lake Erie-Lake League twice.</p><p>After graduation, he joined the University of Cincinnati in 2007, and he switched to fullback and then to the offensive line. Nonetheless, the experiment for his position continued throughout his collegiate career.</p><p>As a sophomore, Jason made 13 starts at left guard, which helped the team’s offense as they averaged 27.3 points and 375.3 yards of total offense.</p><p>Furthermore, the footballer earned second-team All-Big East honors after he helped his team win every regular-season game to become Big East Champions in 2019.</p><p>Jason was again moved to the center position for his senior year, where he flourished the most and was named Honorable Mention All-America and second-team All-Big East.&nbsp;</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>Kelce entered the 2011 NFL Draft, where he got selected by the <a href=#>Philadelphia Eagles</a> in the sixth round and became the starting center for the team.</p><p>The center became the first rookie in Eagles history to start all 16 games at center. Jason was named the starting center for the second consecutive year but missed the season after suffering a partially torn MCL and torn ACL on September 16.</p><p>After his return in the 2013 season, he had an outstanding performance and helped the team reach the 2013 playoffs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Travis-Kissing-His-Brother-scaled.jpg><p>Due to his performance, Pro Football Focus graded him as the <a href=#>best center</a> in the NFL for the season, and he also received the Ed Block Courage Award.</p><p>Kelce agreed to a 6-year/$37.5 million contract extension in 2014 and was selected to his first Pro Bowl despite missing four games after undergoing surgery for a sports hernia.</p><p>In 2015, Pro Football Focus ranked him the 7th best center in the NFL. Moreover, he won Super Bowl LII with the Eagles two years later, playing a major role in the victory.</p><h4>Further</h4><p>The Super Bowl champion again signed a 3-year contract extension worth $24.5 million with the Eagles on March 2, 2019. The following season was very productive for the big man.</p><p>To elaborate, he was one of the 8th finalists for the 2020 Art Rooney Award. Likewise, he was elected to his 4th Pro Bowl the same season.</p><p>On March 5, 2021, the NFL center signed a new extension deal with the Philadelphia Eagles and again restructured his contract keeping him with the team for one more year on March 11, 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2022, he played 16 games for the Eagles, starting in 15 of them, and recorded 1078 snaps.</p><p>The Kelce brothers, Jason and Travis, will make history by becoming the first brothers to play against each other in the Super Bowl as they will represent their respective teams at the Super Bowl LVII.</p><h2>Highlights And Awards</h2><ul><li>One-time Super Bowl champion (LII)</li><li>Five-time First-team All-Pro from 2017 to 2019</li><li>Six-time Pro Bowl in 2014, 2016, 2019, and 2020</li><li>2017 Built Ford Tough Offensive Line of the Year&nbsp;</li><li>Two-time Second-team All-Big East in 2009 and 2010</li></ul><h2>Marriage, Wife, And Daughter</h2><p>The NFL player is married to Kylie Mcdevitt, an athlete who used to play field hockey at Cabrini University.</p><p>She had a great collegiate career with the Cabrini Cavaliers but decided not to pursue hockey professionally.
