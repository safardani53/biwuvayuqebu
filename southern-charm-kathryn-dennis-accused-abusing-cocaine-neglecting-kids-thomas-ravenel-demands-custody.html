href=#>Thomas</a>, 58, filed for sole custody of Kensington, 6, and Saint, 4, on October 23 and requested <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kathryn</a>, 29, have supervised visitation with the kids, The Sun can exclusively confirm.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-03-at-3.27.27-PM.png><p>In the South Carolina court papers, Thomas claimed that since their 2019 joint custody agreement, there have been “changes” affecting the “health, safety and welfare” of the children.&nbsp;</p><p>Thomas believes Kathryn has “relapsed and is no longer sober from illegal drugs.”</p><p>The court papers, which were first obtained by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">All About the Tea</a> claim: “Father is informed and believes that Mother has done cocaine while having physical custody of the minor children.&nbsp;</p><p>“Father is informed and believes that mother has left cocaine within reach of the minor children while the minor children were in her care, creating and placing the minor children in an immediate risk of harm.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000618219488.png><p>Thomas is requesting Kathryn submit to a 10-panel hair test and blood drug test.&nbsp;</p><p>He also claimed Kathryn gave daughter Kensington her old cell phone.&nbsp;</p><p>Thomas and the children’s nanny allegedly “found obscene and pornographic material, including pornographic photos and videos of mother with various men, on the cell phone.”</p><p>Thomas claimed he is unsure of how much of the content Kensington accessed before the phone was taken away.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000618219489.png><p>The court papers also claim the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Southern Charm</a> star allegedly left the kids home alone numerous times and with individuals who failed to watch the children properly.&nbsp;</p><p>He noted an alleged July 2, 2020 incident, where a neighbor called police after seeing their minor child escape from the home and run into the street.&nbsp;</p><p>The court papers read: “When the police arrived at Mother’s residence, Mother was not home and the children’s maternal grandfather was inside the residence asleep.”</p><p>Thomas also claimed their daughter broke her front permanent tooth while in the&nbsp;Bravo star’s care.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/d6f72bcf-0f82-4976-a112-cd4a093909da.jpg><p>He alleged she “failed to preserve the tooth” and take her to the dentist immediately.&nbsp;</p><p>The court papers continued to claim: “Father is informed and believes that Mother routinely sleeps throughout the day, leaving the minor children to fend for themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>“Father is informed and believes [their daughter] has been forced to make meals and care for herself and her younger brother because Mother was incapacitated and/or asleep.”</p><p>Thomas also claimed Kathryn has “routinely failed to get the minor children to school on time or at all.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000618219495.png><p>He said Kensington missed her first day of first grade.</p><p>The court documents continued that the children allegedly live in “unhygienic" living conditions, as Kathryn is a “hoarder” and her home is “unsafe.”</p><p>The papers claimed: “The minor children are routinely returned to Father dirty, smelly, unwashed, with matted hair, and in disarray after being in Mother’s care.”</p><p>Their daughter allegedly told her father they do not brush their teeth with Kathryn because they cannot find their toothbrushes under “all of mom’s stuff.”</p><p>He also claimed the parties’ “notoriety” has “unfairly disadvantaged" the children.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-03-at-3.34.02-PM.png><p>He claimed the kids were rejected as return students to a private school, as the oldest child currently attends a public school.&nbsp;</p><p>Thomas has had “difficulty” finding a private school in Charleston willing to take her as a student.&nbsp;</p><p>The court papers claimed: “Father is informed and believes he will be able to provide the minor children a healthier, more ‘normal’ childhood outside of Charleston, South Carolina, where their parents last name are not as ubiquitously known.”</p><p>He said he found a private school in Aiken, South Carolina willing to take both students beginning with the 2021-2022 academic school year.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/fe30a492-d2e6-4f4a-ba8e-01e219d9dfc1.jpg><p>He believes it is in the children’s best interests to move with the minor children to Aiken, South Carolina.&nbsp;</p><p>Thomas said he can maintain a “safe, stable and secure environment” for the children.&nbsp;</p><p>If he is awarded sole custody he will waive child support from the mother, as he said she is "incapable of responsibly handling her finances and will inevitably default on any child support obligation.”</p><p>He also requested Kathryn be “restrained” from “harming, harassing, stalking, threatening, intimidating or in any way interfering with the Father."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000617256433.png><p>Kathryn has yet to respond to the court filing.&nbsp;</p><p>A court hearing has been set for December.&nbsp;</p><p>A rep for Kathryn did not immediately respond to The Sun's request for comment.</p><p>Kathryn lost full custody of the children in 2016 and entered rehab after she tested positive for marijuana.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, she filed for primary custody of the kids after Thomas was arrested for assault and battery in the second degree.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000550230464.jpg><p>In 2019, the exes agreed to share joint legal and physical custody of their children with Thomas “being the primary custodian” after a nasty court battle.&nbsp;</p><p>The custody war comes as the exes recently appeared to be on good terms.&nbsp;</p><p>During the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">season seven premiere</a>&nbsp;of Southern Charm,&nbsp;Kathryn&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted she was living with Thomas again</a> while her home was under construction following their nasty split.&nbsp;</p><p>She said on the show: “I have actually been staying with Thomas. He’s allowed me to use his master bedroom.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000538683456.jpg><p>She assured viewers: “No, we are&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not back together</a>. Thomas and I are actually getting along. I’m just praying it sticks.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bravo</a>&nbsp;fired Thomas from Southern Charm before season six.</p><p>His children's nanny, Dawn Ledwell, accused him of sexual assault in 2018.</p><p>Thomas pleaded guilty to assault and battery charges last year - four months after he was accused of rape.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of the plea, he paid a $125,000 settlement and was forced to apologize to his former nanny.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000537263585.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-03-at-3.33.38-PM.png><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Thomas said at the time: “While I reiterate that I have never intentionally sexually assaulted anyone, I also acknowledge that by making an unwelcome advance to Dawn in my home, while she was babysitting my daughter, I behaved improperly and caused her immediate and lasting emotional distress.
