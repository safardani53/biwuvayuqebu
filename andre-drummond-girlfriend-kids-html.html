Their hyped&nbsp;romance ended bitterly with regrets and accusations.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Drummond was even alleged&nbsp;of leaking his ex-girlfriend's intimate pictures on the internet. Here's a rundown on how their relationship started and what went wrong during their short fling.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Andre Drummond and Jennette McCurdy's Relationship</h2><p>Drummond's relationship with McCurdy started as a public event on social media, mainly on Instagram and Twitter. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the summer of 2013, the Philadelphia 76ers player started mentioning the stunning actress as his crush. He used her name in the 'woman crush Wednesday' hashtag for weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to his sweet gesture,&nbsp;thousands of followers requested the 29-year-old star to follow him back on his socials. McCurdy was admittedly impressed by his&nbsp;consistent efforts.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>So after proper research, she followed him on Twitter and sent him a&nbsp;message. Besides the public flirting, the duo started having genuine private conversations.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They finally met in L.A. when Drummond visited California over Labor Day weekend.&nbsp;McCurdy penned her experience of meeting her admirer&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">in a blog</a> for the&nbsp;Wall Street Journal in September 2013.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"The&nbsp;Andre Drummond I got to know in person is the same person he projects online," the multi-hyphenate wrote, clarifying that she found the athlete sweet, gutsy, and flattering.</p><p>The then-21-year-old also stated that she got to experience moments that the camera wouldn't capture during her&nbsp;face-to-face date with&nbsp;Drummond.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Reason behind Drummondâ€™s Breakup with Girlfriend</h2><p>Although&nbsp;McCurdy recounted the beautiful moments&nbsp;with&nbsp;Drummond in her tell-all blog, it didn't take her long to realize their chemistry wouldn't work. As a result, she dumped the basketball player and parted with him within a week.</p><p>Almost a year after the breakup,&nbsp;McCurdy opened up about why she left&nbsp;Drummond during an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview on Pete Holmes' podcast</a> You Made It Weird.&nbsp;</p><p>The singer-songwriter revealed that she never found him compatible. But despite the odds, she took things further because she had already announced her relationship with him through her Twitter.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Dropping a bombshell,&nbsp;McCurdy also disclosed that their first kiss was&nbsp;nothing short of terrible.&nbsp;"It just didn't go great ... no sparks. The mouths ... the shapes weren't right," she elaborated in the interview.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Still, she hanged out with the New York native and even accepted a necklace&nbsp;Drummond bought for her. He had offered her the gift on one knee during a dinner date, asking if she would be his girlfriend.&nbsp;</p><p>The theatre actress accepted the romantic proposal at the moment, but she broke up with him over the phone within days.&nbsp;</p><h2>Andre Drummond On Photo&nbsp;Leaks</h2><p>Days after&nbsp;McCurdy became candid about the reason behind her split, her intimate pictures mysteriously&nbsp;leaked online.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Moments after that, the actress took to Twitter to indirectly accuse&nbsp;Drummond of the leak. "To anyone disappointed: I sent those pics to 1 person. You can connect the dots," she wrote in the post.</p><p>And her suggestion spurred rumors he was the one behind the ordeal.&nbsp;The NBA player, however, denied all accusations. Talking about the issue in an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with TMZ</a> in March 2014,&nbsp;Drummond refuted the claims. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Instead, he insisted he wanted nothing to do with her or the situation and claimed to be worried about only his games.&nbsp;Since the split,&nbsp;McCurdy hasn't been vocal about her relationships, albeit sharing a short fling with Canadian actor Jesse Carere in 2015. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her ex-partner, on the other hand, has given birth to two kids. Although&nbsp;it is not confirmed if he has a wife, it is safe to say he has two baby mamas.</p><p>Drummond welcomed his son Deon with Abigail Russo<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in February 2019 and daughter&nbsp;Aubrey EllaRose with&nbsp;Elizabeth Costadoni in March 2019.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmemb%2BmecOrrKaln6OxbrPIq6Ofqpmau6V5yqKbrGaYqbqt</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./erin-lichy-vows-rhony-revenge-against-brynn-whitfield-after-flirty-chat-with-husband-recap.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Erin Lichy Vows RHONY Revenge Against Brynn Whitfield After Flirty Chat with Husband (Recap)">&larr;
