"Anywhere else I was a pansy."</p><p>Hearn went to the less selective Havering Sixth Form College in Romford to study A-levels in media studies, PE and business studies.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Boxing</h2></p><p>He was on a promise from his dad of £1,000 if he got a C or better in his exams. Hearn scored two C grades and one A.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Window shopper</h2><p>Hearn was already showing he was a born salesman when he was just a teenager.</p><p>He immediately put his cheeky chappie persona to good use working in telesales for a double-glazing firm in Essex.</p><p>“I worked for Weatherseal in Romford. I’d go there after college at night and do telesales," he told&nbsp;<a href=#>The Guardian</a>.</p><p>"It’s the worst job in the world but the best training for sales.</p><p>"For every rejection we had an answer on a list – from ‘I’ve just lost my husband,’ to ‘I’ve just done my double-glazing.’</p><p>"We always had a reason to make an appointment."</p><p>Confident Hearn also told the <a href=#>Big Issue</a>: "I was good in front of people. And I had a lot of chat. I suppose I could be a bit of a charmer if I wanted to be."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/22-10-14-promoter-eddie-538075345.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/6e5a47b0-34e9-4d44-a7d1-586fb84dc608.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Aspiring agent to big break</h2><p>When he was 18, Hearn was recruited as a sports agent for LEA.</p><p>He soon prospered, bringing in clients including <a href=#>Ian Botham</a>, as well as several high-profile golf clients.</p><p>His son's work impressed his dad, who invited Eddie on board&nbsp;for a subdivision called Matchroom Golf.</p><p>But it was by chance Eddie got involved in boxing.</p><p>He was sat on a poker table with former heavyweight Audley Harrison, when the <a href=#>Olympic gold medallist</a> asked him for help getting a fight.</p><p>"I was playing in the World Series of Poker and happened to be drawn on the same table as Audley, who asked if he could get on a Matchroom show,”&nbsp;<a href=#>Hearn said</a>.</p><p>“So I phoned up the old man and told him: ‘I think we can do something with Audley.’</p><p>"The phone went stone quiet. Then he said: ‘You’re on your own, I’m going nowhere near him.’”</p><p>Eddie put Harrison on Prizefighter, which he duly won.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">read more sports features</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/97c04a76-9823-476f-87d9-351fea887f77.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/4c39f86e-091d-4952-aa32-f4432dc8205a.jpg><p>And then he got him a European title show, in which the Londoner defeated Michael Sprott in 2010.</p><p>Incredibly, that earned Harrison a WBA title fight with David Haye.</p><p>Harrison was knocked out in the third round, but it put Hearn on the map.</p><p>“Those days are fun because it’s just you against the world," Hearn told&nbsp;<a href=#>Square Mile</a>.</p><p>"No one really knows who you are. You’re just this kid whose blagging it. It’s fun, then.</p><p>"Doesn’t come with the pressures and responsibilities and aggravation now.

Just making sure that it’s running steady," he said.</p><p>"People call me the cash cow, so they’re just checking in on their cash cow and making sure that it’s still creating that milk!"</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Family life</h2><p>Away from boxing, Eddie lives a very private life.</p><p>He is married to the beautiful Chloe, who has been described as his "soulmate".</p><p>Eddie was by her side when the businesswoman opened the doors to her Chloe's Beauty Bar in Brentwood, alongside TOWIE alumni Chloe Sims in 2014.</p><p>The parlour featured regularly on the reality TV show, before closing it down in 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/4ad92467-3841-45a4-b287-a9d739ce18df.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/chloe-sims-opens-new-la-538079218.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/a4f82958-82d6-450d-9cdb-17073e92dbfd.jpg><p>However, Eddie opened up about his family life in <a href=#>The Times</a> in 2019, which includes their daughters Isabella and Sophia.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Writing his own column, he penned: "I get jumped on by the kids about 6.30. It’s a lovely way to wake up — except on them days when you went to bed at 3 … Work takes me away a lot, so if I’m home, my missus expects me to do my bit."</p><p>Speaking about Chloe and their Essex life, he added: "My missus is from west London and she used to take the mick: 'Ooh, I’m dating an Essex boy.' Now? She adores it here. There’s a lot of good working-class people in Essex. And you won’t find no snobbery here, neither."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH92fZBvcGxoX5qxpbXEZp%2BemaKjwG64yJ%2BcZquRobK0ucCnZKaZpJi1s7vOpmSapqSdvK%2FFjKOmrKCllnw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./katy-perry-sequin-crop-top-mini-skirt-jimmy-kimmel-live-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Katy Perry Rocks Sequin Crop Top &amp;amp; Zebra Mini Skirt On Jimmy Kimmel  Hollywood Life">&larr;
