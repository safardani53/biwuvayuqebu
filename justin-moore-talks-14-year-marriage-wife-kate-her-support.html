"There was a moment where we looked at each other and were like, 'Wow, what a romantic wedding anniversary!' But I don't think either of us would want it any different."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The meager meal certainly took the couple back to the early days of their marriage, when Moore was just starting his trek up the ladder to country music stardom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Quite honestly, [Kate] paid our bills for a while," admits Moore, who recently scored his 10th No. 1 "We Didn't Have Much." "A lot of people don't know this, but you can have a solid run up the charts and you still ain't making any money. We couldn't have survived without her and her income. And not only that, I couldn't have survived without her support, because at the time, I was rarely home. I remember being gone for stretches of 100 days and being home just three or four of those days."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, the two persevered both personally and professionally and now find themselves as one of country music's longer-lasting couples. And it's the love that they share that can be heard all over Moore's current single "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>With a Woman You Love</a>," a romantic but completely relatable look at adoration that Moore will feature on a new full-length LP coming later in 2022. He wrote the track alongside Paul DiGiovanni, Chase McGill, and Jeremy Stover.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When you find someone you really love and care about, you don't care if you get made fun of ... and you deal with a cat in the bed," chuckles Moore of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the family cat</a>, Binx. "For me, this song is a reflection of that kind of love."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Indeed, the former Kate Gales was on her high school senior trip in Panama City Beach, Florida when she happened to share a connecting hotel balcony with a certain Mr. Justin Moore.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I had a boyfriend and he had a girlfriend, so we weren't really there to party and stuff," recalls Kate about the week she first met the future country superstar. "We just took care of our friends and hung around and talked."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And during those talks, Kate started realizing that she had found herself, on that balcony at that trashy hotel, a pretty nice guy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That's what did it for me," she tells PEOPLE with a slight chuckle. "As sappy as it sounds, I just loved that he had good morals and he was a good guy. That certainly attracted me to him."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Three days later, Moore broke up with his girlfriend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It took a little longer for Kate to do the same with her boyfriend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm the type of person that hates confrontation. So I just kept avoiding the guy!" she says with a laugh. "One day he showed up somewhere and I was like, 'OK, I hate to break it to you, but I kind of met somebody.' I knew that the person that I was with was not the person I should be with."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Justin and Kate now find themselves not only happily married, but also with a full house of children, including 11-year-old Ella, 10-year-old Kennedy, 7-year-old Rebecca and 4-year-old <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Thomas South</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I couldn't ask for a better partner," explains Kate, who serves as the co-owner of popular children's clothing boutique <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>This Little Piggy</a>. "I mean, Justin changed diapers. He would wake up in the middle of the night. Now he will take some of the kids on the road with him by himself. He's an awesome dad."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, are these two done having kids?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Hell yes," Moore snaps back with a laugh. "We'd have to get some stuff reconfigured, you know?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That would be a miracle!" adds Kate. "That door closed after we had South."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Okwq%2FA0bJmo62jqbavecyopqudXamurbfSZmhtZamarrN5zJqpq6GRnLJuw8ifnGajkamybrTEq2SsraClvLPAjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./taylor-swift-and-olivia-rodrigos-friendship-timeline-what-happened.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taylor Swift and Olivia Rodrigos Friendship Timeline: What Happened?">&larr;
