She was born to her proud parents, Mark Horan and Linda Horan.</span></p><p><span>She has an elder brother named Mike Horan. Regarding how the midfielder started playing soccer, </span><span>Lindsey was 5 when she first showed interest in soccer.</span></p><p><span>She wanted her mother to coach her; therefore, </span><span>Linda Horan coached Lindsey for several childhood years.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Linsey-Horan-with-brother-822x1024.jpg><p><span>Similarly, Lindsey’s brother Mike was her childhood play buddy. Mike Horan never underestimated his sister and challenged her ability during soccer practice.</span></p><p><span>The brother-sister soccer rivalry built Lindsey’s personality as a tough soccer player, always willing to win.</span></p><p><span>Lindsey has always been a Messi fan. There’s a story about why she has a lot of admiration for the Argentine soccer player.</span></p><p><span>Horan’s coach at Colorado Rush, Tim Schulz, first recommended following <a href=# rel=noopener>Lionel Messi</a>‘s game plays.

She first attended Golden High School in her hometown.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, she discovered that her school team would not assist her in achieving her dream of playing for the United States national team.</span></p><p>So she opted to play club soccer with the Colorado Rush and started playing for the Colorado Edge during the U11 tryouts.</p><p><span>She trained vigorously and often chose soccer over her formal education.</span></p><p><span>Horan’s parents saw the dedication and will in her to become one of the greatest soccer players.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lindsey-Horan-with-her-mother.jpg><p><span>As a top-ranked college prospect by ESPN in 2012, Lindsey Horan let go of the scholarship to play for Tar Heels of the University of North Carolina to play for PSG.</span></p><p><span>While doing so, Horan became the first elite American female athlete to abstain from college to participate in the European pro leagues.</span></p><p><span>Consequently, Horan became the first American women’s soccer player to turn professional right after graduating high school.</span></p><h3><span>Offers And Commitments</span></h3><p><span>When Horan finished her junior year, she was about to leave for a family trip to Barcelona, and then she received a life-changing call.</span></p><p><span>The chairman of Colorado Rush and a former director of the French Ligue 1 club A.S.
