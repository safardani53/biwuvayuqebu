His first injury came in August 2020, when he fell off of an electric bike in Malibu and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> broke his back</a> in August 2020. He was hospitalized and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> had surgery performed</a> overnight following the accident. Despite what was undoubtedly a scary injury, he kept a good sense of humor when tweeting about it himself. “Some good advice… If you buy an electric trail bike, read the manual before you ride it for the first time. I have broken part of my back. Thank you to everyone for your kind messages,” he wrote. “And a massive thank you to all the nurses and doctors. Some of the nicest people I have ever met. Stay safe everyone Simon.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Over a year after breaking his back, Simon suffered another <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fall from an e-bike</a> in February 2022. An eyewitness revealed that he had not been wearing a helmet at the time to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Sun</a>,&nbsp;and they said that he had blood rushing down his face in the aftermath. A source revealed that luckily, he was able to bounce back relatively easily. “After being ambulanced to hospital and given an X-ray, Simon was eventually released that evening — his arm in a yellow cast all the way up to the shoulder — and told to rest,” they told the outlet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/simon-cowell-health-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>While no one ever wants to go through an injury, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the&nbsp;AGT&nbsp;judge</a> later admitted that he felt like the injury may have been a blessing in disguise in a May 2023 interview with&nbsp;Today.&nbsp;“I was so unfit before the accident. I didn’t know how unfit I was until I had to do all this stuff afterwards,” he said. “And I’m like, ‘My God.’ Things like that, I believe happened for a reason.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>While he said that the bike accident was “painful,” he did show that he wasn’t afraid of another fall (though he did vow to start wearing a helmet while speaking to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail)</a>. “I’m still gonna stay on my bike,” he said. “I’m obsessed with these things.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><span>Simon Cowell’s Voice: What Happened</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Aside from biking, Simon also had another health issue that affected his performance in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>season 18 of&nbsp;</a><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>AGT.</a>&nbsp;Fans noticed that Simon wasn’t speaking at the start of the season, and he revealed that he lost his voice. The music mogul revealed the lengths they went to to try to figure out what to do about his voice in a 2023 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>USA Today.</a> “It was torture. There was so much I wanted to say, and I literally could not talk,” he said. “We tried writing things. At one point, I used this kind of iPad device where I had things I’d said before. I tried to use <strong>Sofía [Vergara] </strong>to translate for me, and she deliberately said the wrong things, so it was just chaos.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>The X Factor&nbsp;judge also said he went to a doctor who took a camera to his vocal cords and he said he was able to see how “burned” they looked. “I think what happened was the acid from my stomach literally burned my vocal cords,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/simon-cowell-health-embed3.jpg><h2>Simon Cowell Plastic Surgery Rumors & How He’s Doing Now</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>While Simon appears to be in good health, there have been a few hoaxes about the music personality’s death that have gone viral in recent years, but they’ve been found to be false, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Snopes</a>.&nbsp;After one of the more recent hoaxes, Simon did post a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>video</a> on Instagram, congratulating&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>X-Factor</a>&nbsp;alums One Direction on hitting 1 billion streams on their hit “What Makes You Beautiful” on Aug. 10, 2023. In the comments of the post, some fans speculated that he’d undergone plastic surgery on his face, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six.&nbsp;</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Rumors aside, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Simon</a> seems to be doing very well. He’s currently in the midst of filming season 18 of&nbsp;America’s Got Talent,&nbsp;which will air its season finale on Aug. 30, 2023. In early August, he also launched SYCO Publishing, which he called a “boutique publisher dedicated to supporting and developing global songwriting talent.” He shared his excitement in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>statement</a> on Instagram. “There is nothing more important than a great song. I started my career in music publishing. <strong>Mike [McCormack]</strong> and Universal have given me the chance to build a music publishing company. They are a brilliant company and share my wish to work with amazing songwriters,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9KipKimXZi8uLHLpWShnZGhwal5lGprcmljaHw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jason-aldean-and-pregnant-brittany-are-naming-daughter-navy-rome-williams.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jason Aldean and Pregnant Brittany Are Naming Daughter Navy Rome Williams">&larr;
