I have surprised myself.</p><p>“At the start of the year, my ambition was to win one Development Tour title, and I’ve won five.</p><p>“I knew I had the ability to beat the best players on the Development Tour, and I’ve beaten quite a few Tour Card holders — Dylan Slevin, Danny Jansen, Lewy Williams, Keane Barry.</p><p>“It is unbelievable. Now I’ve got my Tour Card, I can’t wait to prove what I can do on the big stages.”</p><p>He revealed about his early years: "By the age of four I got on to the proper board. From 18 months on I have been non-stop.</p><p>"When we moved to Warrington when I was eight or nine we started going out to pubs four to five times a week."</p><p>But while his phenomenal performance at the Worlds won't shock those who have followed his progress, his training regime might.</p><p>Littler's hero and 16-time world champ Phil Taylor was famed for practising all day long.</p><p>But the teen hopeful revealed in August: "At the moment I don’t practise much. I usually do 30 minutes to an hour a day.</p><p>"Some people probably won’t believe it, but if I’m playing against the best, then I’ve got to up my standard.”</p><p>And it seems any hard work has paid off, with his latest exploits, which he admitted were the peak of his career so far, leading to a barrage of praise from ex-pros.</p><p>Wayne Mardle said after his first round performance: “You’ve just witnessed something extraordinary.</p><p>“Luke Littler may be the most naturally talented player I’ve ever seen. Why can’t he win the World Championship?”</p><p><a href=#>Phil Taylor</a> added: “Great performance from Luke The Nuke. Well done buddy keep focused.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/242dc6b2-14a2-448c-8b31-2042d17835c4.jpg><p>But being 16 years old means Littler could not celebrate with a beer like his counterparts.</p><p>Instead, he toasted the occasion with his favourite takeaway — a greasy kebab.</p><p>Littler washed it down with some Fanta and Coca Cola.</p><p>After winning his first two matches, <a href=#>Littler has already taken home £22,500 in prize money</a> and could scoop another £25,000 should he beat Matt Campbell in round three.</p><p>The teenager revealed last week that he realised he had become a phenomenon after he <a href=#>started trending above Kylian Mbappe on X</a>.</p><p>He said: "It has been unbelievable. When I went on Twitter, I was No1 trending.</p><p>"And then No2 was Kylian Mbappe! It’s crazy. Mbappe and me!</p><p>"What I did on Wednesday was unbelievable. What I have done against Andrew was OK.</p><p>"I’m glad I got the win again. I haven’t really replied to anyone yet.</p><p>"I have my Snapchat account with all my friends on it. Then there is Messenger and Instagram. There will be even more messages on there now.</p><p>"This time last Christmas, I was at home, playing on my Xbox. And I was watching the darts.</p><p>"Now, I’m coming back after Christmas to play in the tournament."</p><p>During the four-day darts break, the teenager was<a href=#> back at home with his parents opening presents on Christmas Day</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/day-six-paddy-power-world-867552914.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/e2958761-b85a-453b-bb9d-9e2dc830537f.jpg><p>Speaking after his first round win, Littler revealed: "Walking on, I was nervous but when I stepped on to the stage, I said: 'Wow.'</p><p>"I didn’t want to go into my own shell. I wanted to be myself and I did.</p><p>"That was an unbelievable experience. I hope they will be on my side again. I wanted to win my first game and against Andrew Gilding, I can settle.</p><p>"I heard the chants. I don’t have school. I have a Tour Card now so no school involved. I have not checked my phone. I know what that will be like.</p><p>"I will be up for pretty much the early hours in the morning. I couldn’t sleep last night as I was so excited. My main goal is to come back after Christmas.</p><p>"I cannot put this into words. I have watched the Worlds for many years, seen different people lift the title. I have won a game on this big stage.</p><p>"A lot of people have said I am better than MVG. I can’t agree or disagree because I know what Michael did at my age and what I have done.</p><p>"I hope I can stay above the ton average-wise. I know he’s a slow thrower. I have to find a rhythm.</p><p>"I engaged with the crowd and it got me fired up. I haven’t thought about what I will get my mum and dad for Christmas yet.</p><p>"In my corner my dad and a friend Mike from Liverpool, where I play in the Super league, and my favourite Eloise.</p><p>"It’s unbelievable that Warrington Wolves are supporting me. I go to as many games as I can. A lot of players have been following me on Instagram recently. It is good to look up to them.</p><p>"I will treat myself to a kebab. Get myself some bottles of coke and bottles of Fanta."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Taxi driver dad Anthony and mum Lisa, who works for a scented candle chain, could be in for something special this Christmas if their boy's run continues - especially of he lands the £500,000 winner's cheque.</p><p>He said before the tournament started: "What would I do with half a million? No idea – I'll still be happy with £7,500 if I get beaten in the first round."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH92fZFsb21wX6HCrLGMpaCtrJyav26wwKurrGWbmq%2BirtJmnZqmpJZ6sb7On6ClnV8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mma-gina-carano-naked-sex-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="MMA star Gina Carano blasted for sex photos and told to put some clothes on after postin">&larr;
