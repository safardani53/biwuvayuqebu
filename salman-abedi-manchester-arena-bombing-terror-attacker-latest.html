and his ‘Dumbo’ nickname he was given because of his big ears.</span></p><p><span>His identity was revealed after </span><a href=#><span>armed cops swooped on his address</span></a><span> in Fallowfield, Manchester.</span></p><p><span>Eyewitnesses said bomb disposal officers were spotted entering the 22-year-old’s house before a controlled explosion took place.</span></p><p><span>Minutes before setting off his homemade rucksack bomb </span><a href=#><span>Salman phoned his nuclear scientist mum Samia</span></a><span> and said: "Forgive me", Libyan security forces claim.</span></p><h2><b>Was Salman Abedi linked to ISIS?</b></h2><p><span>The Sun revealed that </span><a href=#><span>Abedi had secret jihadi training after slipping into Syria</span></a><span> during a family trip to Libya.</span></p><p><span>But security forces appeared to have missed a number of chances to stop him after classmates and his own mother warned he was "dangerous".</span></p><p><span>He is believed to have regularly travelled to Tripoli in Libya to visit his family, who moved back there after the fall of dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.</span></p><p><span>He had spent three weeks in Libya and was reportedly in </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Dü</span><span>sseldorf - also known as a hotbed of extremists - four days before the Manchester Arena attack.</span></p><p><span>It was also claimed he </span><a href=#><span>visited Frankfurt in 2015 "to meet like-minded extremists"</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Salman's brother Hashem was arrested in Tripoli following the attack in Manchester and the UK sought Hashem's extradition from Libya.</span></p><p><span>His extradition was delayed in April 2019 due to fighting in the north African country, but returned on 17 July, 2019.</span></p><h2><b>Who claimed responsibility for the deadly attack?</b></h2><p><span>The so-called Islamic State terror group claimed responsibility for the Manchester bomb attack.</span></p><p><span>Just hours after, </span><a href=#><span>ISIS jihadis celebrated the “successful and surprising”</span></a><span> attack and claimed it was "revenge for Mosul airstrikes".</span></p><p><span>One jihadi shared a shot of injured children, saying: “It seems that bombs of the British airforce over children of Mosul and Raqqa has just came back to Manchester.”</span></p><p><span>A public inquiry found that </span><a href=#><span>security failures on the night of the attack</span></a><span> led to more deaths and injury, and that Abedi should have been identified as a threat.</span></p><p><span>In March 2020, </span><a href=#><span>Salman’s brother Hasham</span></a><span> was found guilty of 22 counts of murder, one count of attempted murder encompassing the injured survivors, and conspiring with his brother to cause explosions.</span></p><p><span>Jurors heard that he was "every bit as responsible" as his older brother, Salman for the killings.</span></p><p><span>He was sentenced to at least 55 years in prison.</span></p><p><span>He </span><a href=#><span>later admitted</span></a><span> helping to plot the attack in October 2020.</span></p><p><span>In February 2022, </span><a href=#><span>he was convicted of assault</span></a><span> causing actual bodily harm after he ambushed a prison officer at Belmarsh prison with two other terrorist inmates on May 11, 2021.</span></p><p><span>He was also found guilty of assault by beating of an emergency worker.</span></p><p><span>He received a sentence of three years and 10 months which will be added to his 55-year minimum term.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfaINzgpVva2irkaG6orqMmpmenJliuqK6wqGcrKyVp3qivsSnmGaan6KvqrrGZqueqqKkv26t062YnKOVp3qtrdOeqq1n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jarvis-moss.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Jarvis Moss net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr;
