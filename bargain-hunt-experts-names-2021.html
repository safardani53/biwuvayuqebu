the treasures from the trash.</p><h2>Who are the Bargin Hunt experts?</h2><h3>Kate Bliss</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000335014280.jpg><p>Kate Bliss previously worked as an auctioneer and says that a love for antiques runs in her family.</p><p>Her father had his own salesroom and she became interested in “rummaging for treasure” at a young age.</p><p>Before <a href=#>Bargain Hunt</a>, she was the only female auctioneer at her local saleroom and then moved on to the <a href=#>BBC</a> show – where she then became an expert.</p><h3>Mark Stacey</h3><p>Mark Stacey says that he has always been a collector and he loved collecting stamps and coins as a child.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Read more on Bargain Hunt</h2></p><p>As he got older, he started rummaging around markets and collecting small silvers and works of art.</p><p>He says that antiques “chose him” and that his hobby has turned into his way of life.</p><p>Mark became involved in Bargain Hunt in 2002 after seeing an ad in the antique trade gazette.<br></p><h3>Ben Cooper</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000335011657.jpg><p>Ben Cooper says that when he was growing up his parents always encouraged him to learn – and that included antiques.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>He would often be taken to antique shops and fairs and was given his first antique when he was just eight-years-old.</p><p>Ben is an antique dealer and says that life as such is a "lifestyle not just a job".</p><p>He originally sold to Bargain Hunt in his early days as a dealer – and later went on to become an expert on the show.</p><h3>Catherine Southon</h3><p>Catherine Southon chose a career in antiques because she loves the thrill and excitement of auctions.</p><p>The antiques expert previously worked on Flog It for three years.</p><p>After showing off her talent, she was then asked to take part in Bargain Hunt in 2006.</p><h3>Charles Hanson</h3><p>Charles Hanson chose a career in antiques because he has a love for history and enjoys the drama of an auction.</p><p>He joined Bargain Hunt back in 2002.</p><p>When he's not busy filming the BBC show, he works as an auctioneer.</p><h3>Colin Young</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000335012561.jpg><p>Colin Young started his career in antiques as manager’s assistant at The Bourne Auction Rooms when he was 18.</p><p>He first got involved with Bargain Hunt after failing a screen test to be an expert in the autumn of 2002.</p><p>However, a few months later his company hosted the Bargain Hunt Christmas Day Special,&nbsp; and the series producer was so impressed that he then gained a role as an expert.<br></p><h3>Gary Pe</h3><p>Gary Pe says that he has been drawn to antiques since a young age when he lived on a small island in the <a href=#>Philippines</a> called Marinduque.</p><p>He says that he would imagine the stories behind antiques and try to unlock their secrets and his fascination increased over time.</p><p>Gary got involved with Bargain Hunt after receiving a call from the BBC out of the blue.</p><p>The broadcaster was looking for new faces with different backgrounds and experiences in the trade and, after a long process, Gary joined the team of experts.</p><h3>John Cameron</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000335012796.jpg><p>John Cameron has been interested in antiques since he was young, and grew up with them.</p><p>His grandfather was a dealer, and during his five-year apprenticeship as a carpenter/joiner, he supplemented his income by stripping, restoring and waxing antique pine furniture.</p><p>Later, a back problem forced John to give up his physical job and return to college where he undertook a three-year degree course at <a href=#>Southampton</a> studying fine art valuation.</p><p>He later went on to work at an auction house and become a chartered surveyor of antiques and fine art.</p><p>Prior to working on Bargain Hunt, John appeared as an expert on two other BBC antique shows – Cash In The Attic and Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is.</p><h3>Jonathan Pratt</h3><p>Jonathan Pratt says that he chose a career in antiques after watching Lovejoy in the 80s.</p><p>When it comes to the appeal of Bargain Hunt, he told the BBC: “It’s a fantastic mixture of history and real-life characters in a game-show format, with charismatic experts.</p><p>"What’s there not to like?”</p><h3>Ochuko Ojiri</h3><p>Ochuko Ojiri has vast experience when it comes to antiques and spotting great finds while bargain hunting.</p><p>When asked what his best and worst purchase was, he told the BBC: "I did very well with a flamingo pink 1950’s petrol can and very poorly with a opera hat which folds down so the people behind you can see the action.</p><p>"Turns out people don’t wear top hats to the opera any more…who knew!"</p><h3>Nick Hall</h3><p>Nick Hall started working at an auctioneer when he was in his late teens and says that he quickly “got the Bug” for antiques and art.</p><p>After learning onsite, he went on to take a fine arts course.</p><p>This then lead Nick to earning the position of Senior Valuer and Director at that same saleroom.</p><h3>Philip Serrell</h3><p>Philip Serrell says that he thinks antiques found him “rather than the other way round”.</p><p>He was approached by Bargain Hunt back in 1999, when they were filming in Malvern.</p><p>Philip was then asked to feature as an expert.</p><h3>Raj Bisram</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000335014281.jpg><p>Raj Bisram got into antiques when he discovered that a 9-5 job was not for him.</p><p>He’d had a childhood love of “old and dusty junk” and antique shops and he decided to turn this passion into a career.</p><p>Raj had been doing some other TV work and was approached by Bargain Hunt in 2015.<br></p><h3>Richard Madley</h3><p>Richard Madley comes from a family of antique lovers – his father was an auctioneer, his father-in-law was an auctioneer and his mother-in-law was an antique dealer.</p><p>He joined Bargain Hunt after being approached by a former series producer to ask if he would like to try out.</p><p>After a long interview process, he went on to have a one-to-one screen test in his auction room and was eventually asked to feature as an expert.</p><h3>Thomas Forrester</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict000335014508.jpg><p>Auctioneer <a href=#>Thomas Forrester</a> grew up on a farm and always loved the cattle auctions, and admired the job of the auctioneer.</p><p>He has also had a love of old things since a young age and one of his grandmothers was a massive fan of antiques and auctions and would take him to the local saleroom.</p><p>Thomas was used as a Bargain Hunt auctioneer in his first salesroom in <a href=#>Bath</a> – and is now an expert on the show.</p><h3>Tim Weeks</h3><p>Tim Weeks chose a career in antiques because of the unpredictability of what items you will find each day.</p><p>He also likes performing when he gets up on the rostrum.</p><p>Tim became involved with Bargain Hunt after co-presenting <a href=#>BBC One’s</a> Street Auction.</p><h3>Caroline Hawley</h3><p><a href=#>Caroline</a> first got involved in Bargain Hunt in the summer of 2013 after already working on Flog It for a year.</p><p>She did her first programme from Wetherby racecourse.</p><p>Caroline has been involved with antiques and collecting vintage items since she was a teenager.</p><p class=postsid
