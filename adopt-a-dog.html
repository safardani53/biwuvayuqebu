He needs owners who can help him adapt to his new surroundings.</p><p>He has been learning directional commands and copes well with his deteriorating vision - he still loves a game of fetch and will use his sense of smell to sniff out the ball.</p><p>Billy would like an active home in a rural area where he can spend lots of time with his owners.</p><p>Kelpies are highly intelligent and need plenty of activities to keep their clever minds occupied.</p><p><a href=#>More info about Billy</a></p><p><strong>Name: Jagger</strong><br><strong>Breed: Doberman</strong><br><strong>Age: 5</strong><br><strong>Homeless for: 5 months</strong><br><strong>RSPCA Centre: Danaher, Essex, 01371 851201</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Jagger.jpg><p>Jagger came into the RSPCA care five months ago with a large tumour on his foot, which happily vets were able to remove.</p><p>He’s fully recovered from months of healing and physiotherapy, and back to his usual self - loving to bound around outside.</p><p>Like most Dobermen, he’s intelligent and likes learning new things.

You can also listen to what she has to say in the video.</p><p><strong>1. How to choose the right dog</strong></p><p>Every dog and every family is different. You might have an idea of which dog you want but speak to them and the RSPCA's friendly and informative staff will help you find the best match based on your family, lifestyle and living space.</p><p><strong>2. Settling in</strong></p><p>Just like us, dogs can get scared or worried sometimes, especially in an unfamiliar new environment.<br>Designate a ‘safe haven’ space in your house with a comfy bed so they can go to rest if things get too much without being disturbed.</p><p>If they had a favourite toy or blanket at the RSPCA centre, put that in there so they have at least one thing that smells familiar.</p><p>Establishing a routine is key. Walks, feeding and bedtimes should be around the same time each day so they will know what to expect and build a trusting relationship with you.</p><p>Take your time. Going from an RSPCA kennel to a new home can be overwhelming so just be patient, let them settle into the new home first and get to know you and the immediate family. Then gradually introduce them to new people and environments.</p><p><strong>3. Keep them happy and healthy</strong></p><p>Dogs are intelligent and inquisitive so along with lots of exercise they’ll need toys and training activities to keep them entertained.</p><p>They communicate through body language so owners need to learn to recognise what their signals mean so you can protect them from things that make them anxious or sad.</p><p>Follow these tips and you'll enjoy life with your new rescue dog and know that you’re giving a dog that may never have had a happy home a second chance at a happy life.</p><p><strong>Name: Bollo</strong><br><strong>Breed: Japanese Akita</strong><br><strong>Homeless for: 7&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Age: 7 months</strong><br><strong>RSPCA Centre: Halifax, West Yorkshire,&nbsp;01422 365628</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lisa2.jpg><p>Bollo's previous owner became homeless and could no longer care for him properly.</p><p>He has been in RSPCA care for seven months, having arrived at RSPCA Halifax, Huddersfield, Bradford & District Animal Centre, in West Yorkshire, late last year.</p><p>Bollo is a laid-back dog who loves spending time with people.</p><p>He spends his mornings out walking with the animal centre volunteers and his afternoons with the rehoming co-ordinator in her office.</p><p>He loves sleeping under the desk and enjoys saying "hello" to visitors.</p><p>He also enjoys spending time learning new commands and loves playing with toys, whether it’s chasing balls or chewing toys.</p><p>He’s a gentle giant who would love to find a home to call his own.</p><p>Japanese Akitas are large, handsome dogs who need plenty of space and exercise.</p><p>It’s recommended that they get at least two hours of activity every day. They are likely to love playing in the garden throughout the day too.</p><p><a href=#>More info about Bollo</a></p><p><strong>Name: Harley</strong><br><strong>Breed: Staffordshire Bull Terrier</strong><br><strong>Age: 7</strong><br><strong>Homeless for: 4 months</strong><br><strong>RSPCA Centre: Millbrook, Surrey,&nbsp;0300 123 0740</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Bollo.jpg><p>Harley was given to the RSPCA in February when his owners could no longer care for him properly.</p><p>He is a happy chappy with a dazzling Staffie smile.</p><p>He’s extremely affectionate and loves nothing more than a cuddle.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">How to adopt a rescue dog from the RSPCA</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>If our rescue dogs have melted your heart, here's how you can adopt one.</p><li>Start by checking out the RSPCA website to see what kind of dog you’re looking for and where your nearest centre is.</li><li>Visit your local centre and speak to staff about the sort of dog you’re after and your home environment and lifestyle.</li><li>Fill in an adoption form or have a short, informal adoption interview with a member of staff.</li><li>Once you’ve found your perfect match and reserved your new dog, a volunteer will visit you at home to make sure you’re ready to welcome your new pet.</li><li>Once you're approved, you can collect your dog from the centre and sign all the paperwork.</li><p>There will be an adoption fee to pay that goes towards helping the RSPCA continue rescuing, rehabilitating and rehoming more dogs.</p><p>These fees vary by centre from around £135 for adult dogs to £200 for puppies under six months.</p><p>All RSPCA dogs are spayed, vaccinated and microchipped.
