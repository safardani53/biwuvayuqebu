Our hearts are important!!"</p><p>Fans flooded the comments with their praise for Dylan's sexy look, with one writing: "Hot mamaaaaaa."</p><p>Another added: "So beautiful in every way!!"</p><h2>FORECASTING FITNESS</h2><p>Dylan showed off her incredible figure during a&nbsp;<a href=#>fitness and exercise</a>&nbsp;segment in which she wore&nbsp;<a href=#>stylish</a>&nbsp;skintight leather pants and a sexy low-cut top.</p><p>The segment showcased&nbsp;Dylan,&nbsp;<a href=#>Sheinelle Jones</a>, 44, and fill-in host,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jill Martin</a>, 46, <a href=#>participating in the Start Today workout challenge</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/todays-dylan-dreyer-shows-off-801359324-1.jpg><p>A celebrity trainer taught them how to do a quick workout in 10 minutes while an egg boils.</p><p>All the women were dressed down from their usual business attire, instead opting for comfy workout clothes.</p><p>However, the <a href=#>41-year-old</a>&nbsp;meteorologist still brought her keen <a href=#>fashion</a> sense to the segment.</p><p>She wore skin-tight leather pants, which she could move in easily.</p><p>The&nbsp;talk show host also donned a lowcut, black shirt and put a blue blazer on top of it, to modify herself for TV.</p><p>Since they were doing a workout, Dylan changed out of her boots and into sneakers.</p><h2>COMPETING WITH CRAIG</h2><p>During another recent fitness segment, <a href=#>Dylan called out her Today co-host</a> <a href=#>Craig Melvin</a>, 43, for acting like a “show-off” during the live broadcast.</p><p>The morning show was visited by fitness contributor Stephanie Mansour, who gave the hosts and fans at home some tips on how to kickstart the month with healthy habits.</p><p>She shared a few ideas on how best to navigate a new workout “challenge” for the month, including various workout moves to do.</p><p>After taking&nbsp;<a href=#>Al Roker</a>, 68,&nbsp;for a short walk around the set to get a little cardio in, Stephanie moved over to another fitness station with&nbsp;Craig&nbsp;and Dylan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/dylans-diss-today-s-dylan-800306806-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/dylans-diss-today-s-dylan-800306789-1.jpg><p>With them, she shared a few dumbbell arm exercises before hitting the mats for some body-weight moves.</p><p>Stephanie instructed the Today hosts to get into a plank position on their forearms, in order to work their abs.</p><p>“How you doin’, Craig,” she asked.</p><p>“Doing great,” he replied before the contributor suggested he bump it up by taking the plank from his forearms to his hands.</p><p>He immediately took on the challenge, as did&nbsp;Dylan.</p><p>Craig then decided to take it another step further and started doing push-ups, which was a much different move.</p><p>&nbsp;“Are you doing push-ups, Craig,” Dylan turned to him and asked, before adding: “Are you gonna show off?”</p><p>Not wanting him to have all the fun, she joined in, too, and they started doing push-ups side by side.</p><p>As a teasing punishment for switching up the routine she had planned, Stephanie told them that they now had to go back to a plank and hold it “for the next five minutes.”</p><h2>AL HANDLE IT</h2><p>Last month, <a href=#>Dylan filled in for Al</a>, delivering the weather report in a long black dress with frilly sleeves and matching heels.</p><p>Anchor&nbsp;<a href=#>Tom Llamas</a>&nbsp;turned the show over to the Today correspondent early on in the broadcast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/rokers-replacement-today-s-dylan-801630747-1.jpg><p>He introduced her as such: "Dylan's in for Al, and Dylan, you've got some good news for us."</p><p>"Good news for the warm-up, if you like that sort of thing in February," Dylan said as she began her weather report.</p><p>The meteorologist presented the day's weather clad in a long black dress as well as matching black heels.</p><p>She kept her hair polished and straight in a short bob with light makeup.</p><p>Dylan was all smiles in her heel-skimming dress as she told everyone what to expect in terms of the record highs that many would be experiencing.</p><h2>MAKEUP-FREE DYLAN</h2><p>While the&nbsp;Today&nbsp;host put fashion forward for her TV appearance, she recently proved that she's not scared to show off&nbsp;<a href=#>her more casual state</a>.</p><p>She went all-natural in an&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;snap in which she played with her three young sons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/natural-beauty-today-s-dylan-801105023-1.jpg><p>She captioned her post: "I’m sure this isn’t much of a surprise, but because of my sons, I missed the fact that yesterday was National sons day. Love these boys more than life itself!"</p><p>The&nbsp;host wore a light gray jacket and camo leggings in the photo and pulled her hair into a ponytail for the makeup-free pic.</p><p>Fans couldn't get enough of the authentic look and praised Dylan for going without makeup.</p><p>They also loved seeing the host with her children, looking happy and vibrant.</p><p>One commented: "You are so real and fun to watch! Such a good momma and love your podcast with your husband."</p><p>Another posted: "Looking fantastic Dylan!"</p><p>Dylan shares three children – Calvin, six, Oliver, three, and Russell, one – with&nbsp;her <a href=#>husband Brian Fichera</a>,&nbsp;whom she married in 2012.</p><h2>'NEXT-LEVEL' OUTFIT</h2><p>Dylan recently called out her co-hosts for making <a href=#>comments about her slinky black dress</a> on-air.</p><p>She was clad in a sexy black dress with a see-through mesh collar and sleeves as she welcomed viewers to the show, mentioning it was "Fri-yay" during the opening moments.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/tv-tiff-today-s-dylan-801631751.jpg><p>The TV personality paired her unique look with a sleek bob and light makeup.</p><p>Co-host&nbsp;<a href=#>Al Roker</a>&nbsp;looked over at Dylan and said: "That dress is Fri-yay!"</p><p>Sheinelle Jones&nbsp;snapped her fingers and jokingly said "Dylan's got a date tonight!"</p><p>Dylan scoffed as she replied, "You're being nice now, 'cause you all just bullied me right before the show!"</p><p>Al insisted: "We did not!" as Sheinelle asked, "Do you wanna show America your dress?"</p><p>A clearly flustered Dylan said: "I dressed a little differently today."</p><p>The other hosts insisted they "loved" her dress.</p><p>Al said: "It's just that it's different from what you normally wear! It's next-level!"</p><p><a href=#>Craig Melvin</a>&nbsp;asked: "What did Sheinelle say to you?"</p><p>Sheinelle replied: "I said I look like I'm going to the mall and she's going to prom!"</p><p>The entire table cracked up over the comment.</p><p>Dylan was left stunned and silent briefly before Craig commented.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"It's a beautiful dress," he said.</p><p>The hosts moved on and got the show underway while Dylan was clearly blushing from the attention.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/todays-dylan-dreyer-blasts-co-796483187-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/thumbs-today-s-dylan-dreyer-787352392-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/sheinelle-jones-craig-melvin-dylan-801644226.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZW2GdICSaKuonJGuwG6w2KWYp2WUp7K6sdFmmKaZqprAbrLAp6pmr5mptW6%2F066lp6GenHqntcauqZ5ln6rBp7XTrGY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./billie-eilish-gym-biker-shorts-tank-top-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Billie Eilish Hits The Gym In Biker Shorts &amp;amp; Tank Top: Photos  Hollywood Life">&larr;
