Is the 'RHOA' star finally ready for it to come out? Details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @shereewhitfield</a></figure><p>When <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Atlanta</a> fans first met <a href=#>Shere</a>é<a href=#> Whitfield</a> in 2008, the former football wife had big dreams. After a tumultuous divorce from <a href=#>Bob Whitfield</a>, Shereé wanted to step out on her own to support her children — Tierra, Kairo, and Kaleigh. By Season 1 of RHOA, she decided that fashion would be her next lane, and <a href=#>SHE by Shere</a>é was born.</p><p>Since its launch, Shereé has had several highs and lows with the brand, and it’s been the butt of many jokes on RHOA. <a href=#>Dwight Eubanks’</a> shady "fashion show with no fashions" comment at Shereé's event still resonates with some fans today. Then, Shereé kept the memes coming after she attempted to explain SHE by Shereé's release at the Season 10 reunion (we still never saw any <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joggers</a> in Spring, Summer, or September).</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>During RHOA Season 14, Shereé announced that she's re-releasing SHE by Shereé and will have a fashion show with actual fashions this time.</p><p>On the Sept. 4 finale, Shereé's line officially launched, and fans saw 27 different clothing pieces hit the runway during her fashion show (and Apollo Nida even walked in the event as a model). Though her site launched as the episode was ending, it soon crashed.</p><p>So, is SHE by Shereé out yet? Here's what we know!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is SHE by Shereé out? The website crashed shortly after the 'RHOA' Season 14 finale.</h2><p>After 14 years, countless jokes and memes, and lots of shade from various co-stars, Shereé officially launched SHE by Sheree on Sunday, Sept. 4, 2022 — just as the Season 14 finale finished.</p><p>During the Season 14 finale, Shereé held a fashion show for the clothes, and many RHOA stars and alums were in the audience — including Dwight Eubanks.</p><p>The launch marked the first time that fans could get their hands on any SHE by Shereé pieces, and the collection includes athleisure/activewear clothing.</p><p>However, shortly after it launched, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SHE by Shere</a>é<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> website</a> crashed.</p><p>"Dear Fans," a message on the site's main page read. "Due to the overwhelming interest in She by Shereé the influx of love is crashing the website‼️ But please understand its being worked on so continue to check back in within the next 24 hours. We are working to get this quickly resolved. We wish to serve you soon. Thank you for your interest.Thanks to the customers whom we were able to serve so far tonight."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>The message was still live as of Sept. 6, so it remains to be seen if and when Shereé will be able to get her line up and running again.</p><p>However, as the message indicated, many customers were able to get their orders through before the site went down. Shereé also shared photos on her Instagram stories of her celebrity friends, like WWHL host Andy Cohen, wearing a SHE by Shereé sweatshirt.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Shereé Whitfield’s 'RHOA' co-stars were more than ready for the viewers to see SHE by Shereé.</h2><p>Like several RHOA fans, the cast watched SHE by Shereé's progress through the years. When Shereé returned to the circle in Season 14, she discussed her fashion brand’s journey with <a href=#>Kandi Burruss</a>. In one scene, Kandi applauds Shereé for having the “biggest brand out of this group" that’s not actually a brand. She added that even though people know SHE by Shereé's name, Shereé is hindering her success by not having any merch.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Shereé Whitfield (@shereewhitfield)</a></p></figure><p>"It makes no sense that people can’t buy it yet," Kandi tells Shereé. "Even if you just did a small line, I think it would be sold out in no time. And you could use that money to help invest in hiring more people to take it to the next level."</p><p>In November 2018, Shereé debuted a line of joggers on SHE by Shereé featuring the photos she still has on her site. However, by 2020, she told Andy Cohen on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch What Happens Live </a>that she had scrapped the idea and moved in another direction.</p><p>As viewers found out during the Season 14 finale, that new direction was activewear. Before it debuted, <a href=#>Kenya Moore</a> said that everyone would regret their SHE by Shereé shade by comparing the line to Shereé’s $2 million home she started building in 2010.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Shereé Whitfield (@shereewhitfield)</a></p></figure><p>"I'm hoping she pulls off SHE by Shereé the same way she pulled off Chateau Shereé," Kenya says in a confessional.</p><p>Kenya was right, and Shereé proved all of the haters wrong when her looks hit the runway.</p><p>Catch The Real Housewives of Atlanta Season 14 reunion on Sunday nights at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.
