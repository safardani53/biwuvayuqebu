I’ve referred to the community as ‘my fellow LGBTQ+’ on stage before. There are pictures of me kissing girls online. Why are people just now saying this is news?” said Jackson.&nbsp;</p><p>The pictures she was talking about were snapped in 2018 when she was photographed kissing model Cara Delevingne outside a restaurant.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She iterated that she had talked about having a crush on a girl as an eight-year-old in her&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Rolling Stone</a>&nbsp;interview.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Paris Jackson modeling for Bulgari</strong> (Source: Paris Jackson/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the Rolling Stone feature, the singer revealed she was eight when she fell in love with a female on the cover of a magazine and her father, the legendary Michael Jackson.&nbsp;</p><p>And fortunately for her, her father was very open-minded, and instead of reprimanding her, he made fun of her, saying she had found a girlfriend.&nbsp;</p><h2>Paris Jackson on Still Figuring Out</h2><p>But despite being very outspoken about her beliefs and sexuality, Jackson iterated that she was still “figuring it out.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The ‘Let Down’ singer appeared on&nbsp;Red Table Talk&nbsp;and sat down with host Willow Smith to talk about their lives and careers while growing up in the spotlight.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>They also opened up about their sexualities and shared their&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">experience of coming out</a>&nbsp;and how their family reacted to it.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Jackson shared that she was still figuring it out because her family was very religious, and homosexuality was taboo in their homes.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Most of the Jackson family are Jehovah’s Witnesses; therefore, homosexuality is not accepted, and they do not talk about it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She added that her brothers Omer Bhatti, Prince, and Prince Michaell (II) supported her after she came out.&nbsp;</p><p>And despite the lack of support and understanding from her family, she still had love and respect for her family and their beliefs, culture, and religion.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>But if she were asked to cast aside her beliefs just so she could be accepted, she would not care what people thought of her.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Jackson touched on how lonely she sometimes felt because of how different her views on sexuality were.&nbsp;</p><p>“But there were moments where it was really hard.
