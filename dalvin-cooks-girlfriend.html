She keeps herself under controversies somehow and earns the media’s attention through her freestyle video series and her aggressive, reckless, and dramatic nature with lyrics on the hard street life.</strong></p><p>Tokyo Jetz has been spotted recently supporting her boyfriend Dalvin Cook in a preseason game, wearing her boyfriend’s Jersey to show her support.</p><p>Dalvin Cook had an absolute blast of a career last year, which put him in a great position this year.</p><p>Now with such a supportive girlfriend by his side, it seems like there is only one way he is going, and it’s up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tokyo_jetz_supporting_Dalvin_Cook-e1630980428467.png><p>The fans and general public got to know about the two seeing each other only after Tokyo’s Instagram post.</p><p>So, without further due, let’s see more about Dalvin Cook’s girlfriend, Tokyo Jetz.</p><h2>Quick Facts | Shauntrell Pender</h2><table><tbody readability=8><tr><td width=468><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td width=468>Shauntrell Pender</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Birth Date</strong></td><td width=468>October 26, 1994</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td width=468>Jacksonville, Florida</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Nick Name</strong></td><td width=468>None</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Religion</strong></td><td width=468>N/A</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td width=468>American</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td width=468>Black</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Education</strong></td><td width=468>N/A</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Horoscope</strong></td><td width=468>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td width=468>N/A</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Mother’s Name</strong></td><td width=468>N/A</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=468><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td width=468>Two Elder Brothers & A Younger Sister</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Age</strong></td><td width=468><span>29</span></td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Height</strong></td><td width=468>5’6″/167 cm/1.67 m</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Weight</strong></td><td width=468>123 lbs/56 kgs</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td width=468>Black</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td width=468>Brown</td></tr><tr readability=5><td><strong>Tattoo</strong></td><td>Roses- Arms, Butterfly- Waist, Thighs, And Neck</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Build</strong></td><td width=468>Slim</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Profession</strong></td><td width=468>Musician/Rapper</td></tr><tr readability=7><td width=468><strong>Total Albums</strong></td><td width=468><strong>5</strong> (Viral 2017), (Cancel Culture 2017), (Bonafide 2018), (90’s baby 2018 EP), (Stimulus Package 2020 EP).&nbsp;</td></tr><tr readability=2><td width=468><strong>Record Label</strong></td><td width=468>Grand Hustle / EMPIRE / TOKYO JETZ</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Genre</strong></td><td width=468>Hip-Hop / Rap</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Marital Status</strong></td><td width=468>Unmarried</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Kids</strong></td><td width=468>A Son (Amir)</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td width=468><strong>$1.5 Million- $5 Million</strong></td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Last Update</strong></td><td width=468><span>December, 2023</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Who Is Tokyo Jetz?</h2><p>Born on October 26, 1994, Tokyo Jetz is an American rapper for her hit single No Problem. She was born in Jacksonville, Florida.</p><p>Her birth name is Shauntrell Pender, but she later changes it to Tokyo Jetz. The reason behind unique names mainly for two reasons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tokyo-Jetz-3-1024x1024.jpg><p>The name Tokyo comes from her Asian-like eyes, and Jetz is the name of one of her all-time favorite artists, Curren$y’s song.</p><p>She broke into the internet after uploading a series of freestyle rap videos in her car.</p><h3>Jetz’s Parents, Siblings & Education</h3><p>Tokyo Jetz’s parents divorced while she was young. Thus, she spent most of her childhood living with her dad, two older brothers, and a younger sister.</p><p>She once tried to move in with her mother, who lived in Atlanta during her high school years. But she was forced to live on her own, separately.</p><p>She did not receive much affection from her parents, but she still loves and treats them respectfully despite this fact.</p><p>Her father could not provide much as he took care of four children alone while her mother went away to another city, which deserves to be praised.</p><p>As an ordinary high school kid, she had no income source to live independently. So she ended up returning to Jacksonville and dropped out of high school so she could work and earn a couple of dollars to support her family.</p><p>She never graduated from high school; she only attended 11th grade. As a high schooler, she was interested in poetry and music and occasionally participated in inter-school competitions.</p><p>She may not have graduated from high school, but she sure is doing better in her life.</p><p>Names, ages, or any other information about neither her parents nor any of her siblings are available.</p><h2>The Dating Scene</h2><p>Although the exact date has not been revealed yet, the couple started dating quite recently, as per the information available. As the Instagram post was made only a few months ago, we can safely assume it is, in fact, a fresh and brand-new relationship.</p><p>Like most National <a href=# rel=noopener>Football</a> League players, Dalvin has kept his dating life a top secret. As a result, little information about his past relationships, <a href=# rel=noopener>girlfriends</a>, and dates is available.</p><p>One fact is publicly disclosed that he had a son with his high school love, Jacquilla Morris; they studied together at Miami Central High School.</p><p>In April 2017, Dalvin announced that they were expecting a baby.</p><p>Together they welcomed their first child and decided to name him Dalvin Cook Jr.&nbsp;in 2018.</p><p>Any other info about the child is not shared. It is being kept a secret as of now.</p><p>Though dating a high school sweetheart and having a child with her sounds like a perfect relationship, Dalvin did not put a ring on her finger.</p><p>He might have had second thoughts about being engaged, which is relatively acceptable as it is a big move, or perhaps they were unsure of being with each other.</p><p>Whatever happened, it happened for good, as now Dalvin is dating Tokyo Jetz; getting a divorce is far worse than a mutual breakup.</p><h2>Dalvin Cook’s Girlfriend, Tokyo Jetz | Body Measurements</h2><p>The singer has kept most of her <a href=# rel=noopener>personal information</a> far from the public’s sight. So, we are still retrieving the information about her body measurements.</p><p>However, the singer has a great exterior look with dark black hair, which she often colors. In addition, she has got a diamond-shaped face and black eyes.</p><p>Further, Tokyo has a slim body that weighs 123 lb and has a height of 1.67 m.</p><h2>How Much Does Tokyo Jetz Earn?</h2><p>According to reliable sources, her net worth is estimated to be anywhere from $1.5 Million- $5 Million.</p><h2>Tokyo Jetz’s Personal Life</h2><p>Like her current boyfriend, Tokyo has kept her love life a top secret. She has had a few committed relationships, but we can not precisely pinpoint how many.</p><p>No information about her past relationships and boyfriends is available, making it impossible for us to provide reliable information.</p><p>The only thing we can surely tell is that she has not ever been engaged and that she is currently dating Dalvin Cook.</p><p>In May 2019, she publicly announced on Instagram that she was four months pregnant. Naturally, it was reasonably shocking news for the fans as no one expected such a piece of information from her.</p><p>Later, when asked why she kept it a secret, she said she wanted privacy and peace.</p><h2>Dalvin Cook’s Girlfriend | Son, Amir</h2><p>Tokyo Jetz has a son named Amir, but information about the biological father is unknown. Her son, Amir, was born on September 16, 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tokyo-Jetz-and-her-son.-819x1024.jpg><p>In 2023, She has also made a dedicated Instagram account for her 4 years old son, where she posts his pictures and videos.</p><h2>Featured&nbsp;</h2><p>Tokyo has been featured by Rolling Out with her new bone baby of 6 months, which is her one and only child.</p><h2>Dalvin Cook’s Girlfriend, Tokyo Jetz | Career</h2><h3>Early Career</h3><p>She started as a poet in high school and gradually got into hip-hop and rap culture. It was one of her brothers who encouraged her to turn her poems into lyrical verses for rap.</p><p>In 2012, one of her songs became a hit in her hometown, which was probably her first break ever. Later, she decided to post content on social media platforms to grow her career as a rapper.</p><p>Luckily this decision proved to be a life-changer, literally. She gained popularity through her freestyle videos.</p><p>In 2016 she rapped over Yo Gotti’s Down in the DM with her original verse, which received quite a lot of attention and views.</p><p>Tokyo Jetz moved to Atlanta to further develop her musical career as a rapper in early 2017. Soon after, she went on a tour around the United States with fellow artists signed to Grand Hustle.</p><p>Jetz had an unfulfilling childhood; her parents were divorced, and her family did not have much to offer financially. Therefore, she grew up in a rough area of the city, as rents are usually cheaper in those areas.</p><p>Jetz stated that she remembers living off section 8 and food stamps. She did not have a happy childhood growing up in the projects.</p><p>Slowly but steadily, she grew her internet persona as a freestyle rapper who raps about the bitter truth of the street lifestyle. Her style seems aggressive, but she can also be high-spirited, depending on the mood and demand of the bars.</p><p>After being viral on the internet, she was noticed by T.I., a famous name in the rap industry. T.I. later signed her to Grand Hustle, a record label, in 2016.</p><p>Since then, she has collaborated with rappers such as T.I., Trina, and Kash Doll.</p><p>Tokyo did her event for 2022 at Enmarket Arena [Apr. 2nd, 2022], Black Station Presents Spring Fling 2022 by BEEZY ENT held in Savannah, GA.</p><h3>Critics</h3><p>The well-known Kazi magazine has also published an article about Tokyo.</p><p>“I’ll not call her strong because black women are subjected to have to be that too much. To me, she’s adaptive and resourceful.” reads the second paragraph.</p><p>Revolt. Tv recently posted an article reviewing her latest album Cancel Culture which came out in 2021. They remarked, “the Grand Hustle artist did not disappoint.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tokyo-Jetz-Cancel-Culture-1024x1024.jpg><p>Similarly, Respect-mag.com posted a similar article reviewing Cancel Culture. They, too, spoke highly of the album and praised the lyrical and artistic talent of the rapper.</p><p>They made remarks on a track from Cancel Culture titled Know The Rules. The article read, “Know The Rules proves again why Tokyo is a natural force in the rap game with her slick lyrics and consistency.”</p><p>They further added, “empowering women to have their own and demand more from men.”</p><p>Femalerappernews also commented on one of her songs named No Love Story. “No Love Story is the perfect song for the club.”</p><p>They also reviewed her other song named&nbsp;See Me. “She brings great lyrics in the verses. But she also creates a catchy chorus.” claimed the website article.</p><h3>Youtube Channel</h3><p>Aside from her musical career, she also runs a YouTube channel where she posts vlogs. In one of her vlogs, posted on June 13, 2019, there is a short clip of her talking to her boyfriend over a video call.</p><p>Though the face is not shown in the vlog, we can reasonably assume that he is the child’s father.</p><h2>Who Jetz Listened To Growing Up.</h2><p>Tokyo Jetz is a huge Tupac fan. Even today, she aspires to be like him in every possible way.</p><p>Despite being a Tupac stan, she also enjoyed listening to Biggie. Other names that influenced her include Boyz II Men, Toni Braxton, Mary J. Blige, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, etc.</p><h2>Tokyo Jetz Albums</h2><p>In August 2017, Grand Hustle released a single named “Sunshine Baby,” which became a hit, followed by “My Story,” which was also a success. This was her debut record, professionally and for the Grand Hustle records.</p><p>This debut album featured London Jae, T.I., Sy Ari Da Kid, and others. The album had a total of 2 million streams online.</p><p>Her very first album was named Viral.</p><p>In 2018, she officially released her second album, which featured artists such as T.I., Trey Songz, EarthTone Lyrix, Trina, and others artists. The album was named Bonafide.</p><p>Likewise, in 2020 she released her third album, Stimulus&nbsp;Package, which was not as successful as her prior albums.</p><h2>Tokyo Jetz Faces The Wrath Of Critics</h2><p>In the same year, she received quite a harsh backlash from her fans as she made an irresponsible and offensive comment while going live on her Instagram.</p><p>Tokyo made a joke about George Floyd’s death. She uploaded an Instagram story on June 1, not even a week after George’s death, making an offensive statement.</p><p>She was play-fighting with her friend and said, “I’m a George Floyd, your motherf***ing a**.”</p><p>After this, she received a lot of backlash plus a whole lot of criticism. She decided to record and upload an apology video, apologizing to the black community and all the people she hurt through the comment.</p><p>Jetz started the apology video by saying, “There is no excuse; that’s not what this is at all.” Followed by, “I’m not doing this video to ask for no sympathy cause what I did was wrong as hell.”</p><p>She added, “First and foremost, I want to just apologize to the family, to people on the frontlines, to people who stand up for us.”</p><p>Tokyo also stated that she does not want anyone to take her statements as an excuse.</p><p>This happened in July 2020 when cancel culture was on the rise. So many pointed out that she should be canceled. But luckily, that did not happen.</p><p>She responded to the criticism and wrath of the cancel culture she faced by releasing a Cancel Culture album in 2021.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Tokyo Jetz earned popularity with the help of social media.
