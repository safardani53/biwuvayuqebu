He had interest from Real Madrid and Barcelona, he was in all of the newspaper articles, he was the one who signed a boot deal the earliest.</p><p>"Listen, he was a fantastic footballer. He was so quick, and listen, he didn't not make it; he had a loan move to Swansea and then he went to Hereford.</p><p>"But he just didn't have the career that everyone expected.
