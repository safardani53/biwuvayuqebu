She has a brother, Aleksandr, who is also her coach.</strong></p><p>Anastasia Sergeyevna “Nastia” Pavlyuchenkova is a Russian professional tennis player whose career-high singles ranking is #11 (on November 8, 2021).</p><p>She started playing tennis at an early age, and as a junior prodigy, she won three Grand Slam titles.</p><p>Pavlyuchenkova even became the junior world No. 1 at the age of 14 in January 2006.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Anastasia-Pavlyuchenkova-A-Russian-Professional-Tennis-Player.png><p>Her success in juniors earned her a place in ITF and WTA tournaments, and she won an ITF event in Italy in May 2006.</p><p>The Russian tennis player participated in 48 consecutive Grand Slam tournaments between the 2008 French Open and the 2020 Australian Open, tying with <a href=#>Ana Ivanovic</a> for the ninth-longest consecutive Grand Slam appearances.</p><p>Moreover, Pavlyuchenkova has won 12 singles titles and 6 doubles titles on the WTA Tour.</p><p>Besides she has also represented her national team in different competitions. She was part of the winning team at the 2020-21 Billie Jean King Cup and also won gold at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in mixed doubles.</p><h2>Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova Brother Aleksandr</h2><p>Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova was born as one of two children to her parents, Sergey and Marina, on July 3, 1991.</p><p>She has a brother named Aleksandr Pavlyuchenkova, who is almost 6 years older than her.</p><p>Aleksandr, born on December 3, 1985, is a Russian tennis player. His career-high <a href=# rel=noopener>ATP singles ranking was</a> #704, which he achieved on September 8, 2003.</p><p>He trained at the Juan Carlos Ferrero Academy and was a top junior player. But Anastasia’s elder brother quit the sport when he was 18 or 19.</p><p>It was only in 2021 Aleksandr returned to tennis and joined forces with Anastasia. Since 2021, he has been serving as a coach to her sister Anastasia.</p><h2>The Bond Between Pavlyuchenkova Siblings</h2><p>The Pavlyuchenkova siblings have always been close and supported each other.</p><p>Aleksandr has always been the greatest motivator to his sister. Any big games, Aleksandr had a word of advice to give to his younger sister.</p><p>When Anastasia lost to eventual champion Naomi Osaka in the first round of the 2021 Australian Open, she called her brother.</p><p>After the loss, Pavlyuchenkova was not feeling good, and she called her brother to help her train for a week.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Anastasia-Pavlyuchenkova-With-Her-Brother-And-Martina-Hingis.jpg><p>His brother motivated her saying, “You are playing so good you just have to believe in yourself more.”</p><p>Now that they are working together, Aleksandr supports her emotionally as a brother and tactically as a coach.</p><p>Anastasia was asked if she had an issue working with her brother, and she cleared that they had no issues working together.</p><p>“I can always separate brother and sister, I never think about it,” she said. “When I am on the court I look up in the box and I see my team there, first of all, I see my coach, my physio and people that work for me and my team – we work together to achieve our goals.”</p><p>“I never think that this is my brother, this is my dad, this is my mom, my friends, that’s not it. I look at him as my coach. And we used to work before when I was a junior, and also my dad was always the coach, my family was always involved, that’s why I always say that without them I wouldn’t be there, probably a lot of people don’t know but he’s been around and he always participated in my tennis for a long time, all the junior career I was actually with him.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCtzZqqrZmjnq5uvMCvo7Ktk52yr7fOr5hmmqKkwamx0WaYpZ2bqK6vsNFmoKxlmJq%2FbrnOraCvmaSevK97</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./grammys-2021-hottest-men-in-tuxedos-suits.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Grammys 2021: Hottest Men in Tuxedos, Suits">&larr;
