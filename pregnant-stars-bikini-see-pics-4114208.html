Being pregnant and already getting influenza b my first trimester there was no question about immediately going into hibernation. I thought about my baby’s safety immediately. I have been hibernating for a week or so already and have taken this time to increase my mediation, reading time, bonding time with Artem through fun activities, hanging with family, working from home, writing, playing board games and just enjoying the chill time. Brie and I have had to cancel a lot of exciting things in our career, it was hard to but it was the right thing to do. This is a time to sacrifice and help. Let’s all think of our elderly, one of the people I love most in this world is my Nana. The things I have seen on social media I couldn’t even imagine if it was my Nana in that situation. Broke my heart. If you can and it’s safe for you, help our elderly, be thoughtful in the supplies you get, and see if you can do drop offs to them. This time is about hibernating, bonding, sharing and most importantly trying our best to be selfless and peaceful. Sending so much love and light to you all! 💛✨Also working on a very cool video with Artem for 9 million followers! Goodness thank you all! Love you all! And how blessed are we that we live in a time where we can stay connected through technology. Stay healthy and safe. ❤️🦋✨🌎</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Nikki Bella</a> (@thenikkibella) on Mar 15, 2020 at 1:28pm PDT</p><p id=content-paragraph-36>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-37>Nikki has been updating her devoted fans on her pregnancy every chance that she gets.
