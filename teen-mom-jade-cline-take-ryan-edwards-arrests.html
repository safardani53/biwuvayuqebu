I think it's just people making mistakes," the TV star concluded.</p><h2>FAN BACKLASH</h2><p>The video was shared on the gossip fan page, <a aria-label="Teem Mom Fanz (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Teem Mom Fanz</a>, where fans expressed mixed feelings about Jade commenting on the topic.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>One viewer mocked the star in the comments, writing: "Jade stays minding other ppl’s business," with a laughing, crying face emoji.</p><p>Another also felt Jade's remarks weren't necessary, adding: "She isn’t far enough removed from Maci to make such a public comment. Imo, it’s stepping boundaries a bit. A simple 'no comment' goes a long way."</p><p>A third ranted: "Maybe she felt like she had to say something and show support publicly to not look bad. She played it safe by supporting both sides without actually explaining herself and only giving her opinion which is still not ok.</p><p>"I would’ve personally reached out and let her know that she’s there for her without asking any questions."</p><p>A fourth critic chimed in: "Not every question needs an answer! Maci is 'your Friend' but you talking about her business. when she hasn't even said anything."</p><p>And a fifth agreed: "I just feel like this don’t got nothing to do with her…send prayers for the kids thru a text or call and leave it at that."</p><h2>THE SENTENCING</h2><p>On April 20, Ryan, 35, was&nbsp;<a href=#>sentenced to one year in a Tennessee prison</a>&nbsp;after he was arrested again on April 7 for possession of a controlled substance and driving under the influence.&nbsp;</p><p>The ex-<a href=#>Teen Mom OG</a> star was&nbsp;<a href=#>in court Thursday</a>&nbsp;regarding the two new possession of a controlled substance and DUI charges, as well as the previous two harassment and possession of controlled substance charges.</p><p>He entered the courtroom in handcuffs and faced Judge Gary Starnes, according to a U.S. Sun reporter who attended the court appearance.</p><p>His attorney said: "Mr. Edwards concedes he did violate his probation," meaning to admit.</p><p>A lawyer for the state said: "It appears Mr. Edwards would've violated probation by leaving treatment early. Mr. Edwards picked up two new criminal charges. For the court, given part of the probation violation is these new charges, he's conceding the violation."</p><p>Judge Starnes said: "He was supposed to be in Austin, Texas. He was admitted March 16 and was discharged April 3."</p><p>The state's attorney called an officer to take the stand.</p><p>The officer said of the April 7 arrest: "I was dispatched for a white male in a white pickup truck who was unconscious and unresponsive. The vehicle was running in drive.</p><p>"The truck rolled into a curb on the driver's side. The curb stopped the vehicle. It was just Mr. Edwards. He was unconscious, unresponsive. Fire was there. They were using a lockout kit to gain entry to the vehicle.</p><p>"He did not regain consciousness until he was put in medical and administered Narcan. There were two small baggies on Mr. Edwards. A white-blue powder and a crystal substance."</p><p>A lawyer for the state then said: "This court is used to seeing probation violations, this defendant received a lenient break from this court and my office in March. He was given the opportunity for the second or third time to pursue rehabilitation.</p><p>"He has a drug problem. He had an opportunity to pursue rehabilitation.</p><p>"He failed to do that. He was there for two weeks.</p><p>"He left the facility contradictory to the staff's advisement. The staff was trying to keep him there.</p><p>"He was ordered to be there for 45 days.</p><p>"He somehow got back to Chattanooga. Then a block from this courthouse, while so under the influence in his vehicle, he ran into a curb.</p><p>"He could've hit people. He's a danger to himself and the public.</p><p>"His option is to get clean or die. There will be a request for more rehabilitation.</p><p>"The opportunity he had he squandered. That is disrespectful to the court and makes a mockery."</p><p>She recommended 11 months and 29 days in prison.</p><p>Ryan's lawyer then said: "He's addicted to drugs.</p><p>"We all know there is a good person deep inside there wanting to get out. That person is hammered down deep because of the drugs.</p><p>"We all want the best for him and the community. We ask, at some point, not today, after Mr. Edwards receives sufficient time to be punished and think about what he's done to consider an alternative. We're all disappointed.</p><p>"It's a small town. We all know each other.</p><p>"We all know him. We want him to do better.</p><p>"There is a unique treatment option. I'm not asking the court to suspend his sentence."</p><p>They then called up the director of court services, who recommended Ryan receive monthly shots and attend a two-year program.</p><p>She said: "He would go into a residential program and at some point he would get a once-a-month shot. It curbs cravings coupled with treatment.</p><p>"Just a shot isn't going to do it. He says he will do that.</p><p>"He would go in and stay at our facility. Then step down to a halfway house, a separate living house. They do counseling for two years."</p><h2>'I AM TRYING TO SAVE YOU'</h2><p>The judge then said: "We all know Mr. Edwards and his family. He's a very fine young man.</p><p>"He's very talented at what he does. We've all watched him grow up.</p><p>"He is not a bad person. He just got addicted to hardcore drugs.</p><p>"He's an extreme danger to himself, he died on Broad Street and had to be brought back to life. You would've been dead.</p><p>"You should realize that. He's a danger to the public by driving his truck on drugs.</p><p>"Rehab won't be good because he won't do it. He needs to grow up, you know that.</p><p>"You have three kids. You may have some problems with your wife, but you have three kids. I'm trying to save your life.</p><p>"I'm going to revoke probation for 11 months and 29 days in custody. At some point, I may send you to rehab.</p><p>"You won't do it now. It's because the drug addiction is so strong.</p><p>"You can't do it. You have to grow up and want to save yourself.</p><p>"I'm going to do what I can to save you. If you come across someone at drugs at Silverdale stay away from them."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Though he was sentenced, Ryan is due back in court on June 12 regarding the four charges.</p><p>Ryan's parents, Jen and Larry, attended the court hearing&nbsp;as well as his estranged wife, <a href=#>Mackenzie</a>, 26, though they did not sit together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/teen-mom-fans-praise-jade-779286583.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/teen-mom-star-ryan-edwards-808665884-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/www-instagram-com-p-cemxnh0pabz-794744691-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvaWuEdn2YaKuenZ5iurC5jKOYnZ1dmLmqusRmq5qjlWK%2Fuq3NZpydr5GnsbR5wKupnqukqHw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-flash-season-8-episode-6-broadcast-date-when-will-it-air.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Flash Season 8 Episode 6 Broadcast Date: When Will It air?">&larr;
