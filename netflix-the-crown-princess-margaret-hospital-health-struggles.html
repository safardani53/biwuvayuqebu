despite four monarchs having died from smoking-related illnesses, including her own dad, King George VI.</p><p>Never afraid of speaking her mind, she refused to bow down to pressure from both doctors and members of her family to ditch the cigarettes.</p><p>However, it is reported she cut down to 30 a day, rather than 60.</p><p>Determined Margaret also continued with royal engagements -
