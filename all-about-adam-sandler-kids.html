"I love that kid … I was dying to do it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sadie's little sister, Sunny, joined the family in late 2008, and since then, the Sandlers have kept a low profile when it comes to their home life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My kids give me the most joy, but there are life adjustments," Adam told the HuffPost in 2018. "I don't go out to meet anyone after 9:30 at night. I eat dinner at 6 or 7. If someone makes me stay out until 10:30 at night, I'm angry the entire next day because I'm exhausted."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>James Devaney/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sadie and Sunny have appeared in several of their father's films over the years, including his 2020 Netflix movie, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hubie Halloween</a>. But it wasn't until 2023 that they landed starring roles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Netflix's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah</a> follows seventh-grade student Stacy&nbsp;(Sunny) as she plans her dream bat mitzvah amid a rift with her best friend, while her mom (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Idina Menzel</a>)&nbsp;and sister (real-life sibling Sadie) encourage her to make peace. To round out the family affair, the movie also stars Adam as Stacy's father and Jackie as a woman named Gabi.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As an A-list actor in Hollywood, Adam can get tickets to just about anything. In October 2023, he took his daughters to the Los Angeles premiere of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taylor Swift's concert film</a>, and following the screening, the pop star took photos with Sadie and Sunny.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From their early years out of the spotlight to their starring Netflix roles, here's everything to know about Adam and Jackie Sandler's two daughters, Sadie and Sunny.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sadie-sandler-17></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Sadie Sandler</strong>, 17</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Allen Berezovsky/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Adam and Jackie welcomed their first daughter, Sadie Madison Sandler, on May 6, 2006. Shortly after her arrival, the comedian joked to reporters about his newborn's lack of focusing skills. "Every time I think the kid likes me [while I'm playing with and talking to her], I'm like, 'Oh, she's staring at my forehead," he cracked.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Sadie was 14 months old, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>her dad told Jay Leno</a> on The Tonight Show that he had "dethroned" Jackie as the little girl's favorite person. "We're very tight with this child – everything we do is about the kid, and the kid now all of the sudden worships me. It was my wife the whole time and then the last month or two, it's all Sandler. It's like anything I do, the kid wants to do," he joked.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At a young age, Sadie started accompanying her father on set, making her first on-screen appearance in his 2008 movie, You Don't Mess with the Zohan. That same year, she had a small role in Adam's film Bedtime Stories, in which the actor plays an uncle whose tall bedtime tales stir up trouble for his niece and nephew. While promoting the movie, Adam admitted that the plot hit a little close to home, as his nightly bedtime story ritual often had a reverse effect on Sadie.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm not great at the bedtime stories," he said. "The bedtime stories are supposed to put the kid to sleep, [but] my kid gets riled up."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Frank Trapper/Corbis via Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sadie's bedtime routine was again a topic of conversation for her father during a 2008 appearance on Live with Regis and Kelly, where the actor revealed that she was the one to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tell him that he was about to be a father of two</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I came home at night and [Jackie] kept saying 'Sadie wants to give you a present,' and normally Sadie falls asleep around 8. It was like quarter of 9 and I just got back from working," he recalled.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"And then Sadie hands me a little something, like a gift. And I was 'Aww, that's nice Sadie, thank you.' And then Jackie kept saying 'Open it up, open it up.' And I open it up and it was one of those pregnancy [tests] and I was like 'Woowww.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2019, Adam spoke about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>watching Sadie grow up,</a> telling <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Ellen DeGeneres</a> that listening to his almost teenage daughter talk about boys was tough.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You know, I drive around with [her and] her friends and I hear them talking about boys now … it's amazing, the feelings I had about the same boys five years ago. When they would mention the kid's name, I'd be like, 'I love that kid.' Now, I get very jumpy," he joked.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it came time for Sadie's bat mitzvah in 2019, Adam pulled some serious strings to make his daughter's big day extra memorable, including arranging a special performance from Maroon 5 frontman <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Adam Levine</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Adam explained on Jimmy Kimmel Live that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>he asked Levine by text</a>, saying, "I text him, 'I'm sorry to do this to you, my kid's getting bat mitzvahed Saturday night. Would you mind coming and singing a few tunes? It would be incredible.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Levine agreed, and brought along fellow Maroon 5 bandmate James Valentine to play a few hits at the party. "It was the coolest thing, man," Adam told Kimmel. As for Sadie's reaction to the performance? "Oh, she hugged me so much, my Sadie," he said.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sunny-sandler-15></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Sunny Sandler</strong>, 15</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Allen Berezovsky/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Adam and Jackie welcomed their second daughter, Sunny Madeline Sandler, on Nov. 2, 2008. Adam <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>announced Sunny's birth on his website</a>, calling the family's latest addition "beautiful" and adding that "everyone is happy and healthy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like her older sister, Sunny has appeared in several of her father's movies, including Grown Ups, Blended and Murder Mystery. After accumulating over a dozen acting credits from Adam's projects, however, it appears that both Sunny and Sadie are ready to strike out on their own.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I hear sometimes in the house, 'I wanna be in a movie' and I say, 'You are, you were in this, this and this' and they go, 'Not yours.' I go, 'Oh, Daddy's not good enough!' " Adam said on The Drew Barrymore Show. "They wanna do their own thing one day."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to her acting roles, Sunny also has a passion for singing. In June 2019, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>she performed a song</a> from The Greatest Showman onstage during one of Adam's comedy shows. After a sweet introduction from her father, Sunny belted out "A Million Dreams," earning her a huge applause and a standing ovation from the crowd.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sunny <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>accompanied her dad onstage again</a> that October during a charity performance, where she and Sadie joined Adam in singing a rendition of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Taylor Swift</a>'s "Lover," which the comedian described as "one of their favorite songs."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mariah Wild/Disney Parks via Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We're gonna sing a song! They've been so excited and nervous, but we're gonna sing a song," Adam told the crowd. "They saw <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taylor Swift</a> last night, we were at Saturday Night Live. That was a big night, man. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Taylor Swift</a> — holy s—."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the girls drew a standing ovation, Adam thanked the crowd for "being so nice to them," adding, "They were dying to be a part it. Girls, you did great! Sounded awesome — confident and cool. I love you, now get out of here."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For Sunny's bat mitzvah in May 2022, Adam again turned to his celebrity friends to make the party extra special. The star-studded bash was attended by his previous costars <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Aniston</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Taylor Lautner</a>, and included performances from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Charlie Puth</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Halsey</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Halsey later discussed the party during an appearance on The Tonight Show. "First of all, it was the craziest bat mitzvah I've ever seen in my life," the singer told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jimmy Fallon</a>. "As you would expect from Adam Sandler. It was like… I mean, it was like Coachella."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sunny was seemingly pleased by the party's A-list guest list — and the attention that came with it. After a TikTok user shared a video from the bash, which showed several celebrity attendees posing with a giant Smarties candy package, Sunny summed up the event with a one-worded comment: "Viral."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gilbert Flores/Variety</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few months later, Sunny and her sister had another viral moment when their father received the Film Tribute Award at the 2022 Gotham Awards. Instead of going the traditional route, he allowed his daughters to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>write his acceptance speech</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They were like, 'Can we write your speech so you've got something to say?' I said, 'Absolutely! It would be nice to see you doing something other than watching YouTube or going to f------ Lululemon every f------ weekend,' " Adam teased on stage before going on to read the speech his girls prepared for him, which included several hilarious jabs at their father.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The proud dad ended his speech on a sentimental note, thanking his wife and daughters for being a part of his journey.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CWv6a606xmmqScYq6ju9StZJqckaJ6tK3NnaOeql2gtqW%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./antonio-brown-raps-at-rolling-loud-festival-after-nfl-exit.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Antonio Brown Raps at Rolling Loud Festival After NFL Exit">&larr;
