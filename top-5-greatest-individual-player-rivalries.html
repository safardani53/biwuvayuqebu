When such players compete for trophies, records, and the title of greatest of all time, we have a recipe for a heated rivalry.</p><p>Football clubs each have their own set of rivals. As a result, great players who play for rival clubs are subjected to the heat of the competition. Being pitted against top-tier players tends to bring out the best in some people, and thus such environments are critical to a player’s development.</p><p>Without further ado, here are five of the greatest individual player rivalries in history.</p><p>Iker Casillas-Gianluigi Buffon, Ruud van Nistelrooy-Thierry Henry are among the honorable mentions.<br>Goalkeepers Iker Casillas and Gianluigi Buffon were among the best in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Both players won the FIFA World Cup with their national teams and had successful club careers. The two gentlemen are widely adored in the football world, and they have a lot of mutual admiration.</p><p>Ruud van Nistelrooy used to be Manchester United’s henchman when Thierry Henry was tearing up the Premier League. Arsenal and Manchester United had the most heated rivalry in the English Premier League at the time, with both elite strikers at the center of it.</p><h2>Number 5: Gerard Pique – Sergio Ramos</h2><p>On the international stage, Sergio Ramos and Gerard Pique were teammates. As part of the same backline, they started the 2010 FIFA World Cup final against the Netherlands. They’ve played nearly a hundred matches for Spain’s national team.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gerard-Pique-Sergio-Ramos-.jpg alt="Gerard Pique Sergio Ramos&nbsp;" width=650 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>However, Ramos and Pique had a tense rivalry at the club level. Both players are outspoken, and their relationship has been deteriorating since 2015. Pique mocked Real Madrid after they beat them to the La Liga title in 2015. He even referred to Alvaro Arbeloa as a “cone” for his static defending.</p><p>Ramos retaliated, claiming that Pique’s actions and words would harm the Spanish national team. During previous El Clasicos, the two have clashed numerous times on the field. At the end of the day, Ramos and Pique are two of the modern era’s greatest defenders.</p><h2>Number 4: Franz Beckenbauer – Johan Cruyff</h2><p>Two of the greatest footballers of all time are Johan Cruyff and Franz Beckenbauer. They were unquestionably the greatest players of the 1970s, which is why it only took four iterations of their meeting to become one of the greatest rivalries of all time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gerard-Pique-Sergio-Ramos-.jpg><p>Beckenbauer and Cruyff were both extremely dynamic footballers who could do almost anything on the field. Cruyff played for Ajax, while Beckenbauer was the main man for Bayern Munich. They first met in the European Cup quarterfinals, with both men captaining their respective teams.</p><p>The rivalry heated up when the Netherlands faced Germany in the 1974 World Cup final. The Germans won a comeback victory and were crowned world champions.</p><p>Cruyff led Ajax to three European Cup victories in 1971, 1972, and 1973. In 1974, 1975, and 1976, Beckenbauer did the same with Bayern Munich. Beckenbauer won the Ballon d’Or twice in 1972 and 1976, while Cruyff won it three times in 1971, 1973, and 1974.</p><h2>Number 3:&nbsp; Roy Keane – Patrick Vieira</h2><p>When you hear “heated rivalry,” you imagine two stalwarts getting in each other’s faces and fighting tooth and nail for every price. You’d think of two war generals whose volatile tempers could easily spark a bloodbath. That was exactly how the Patrick Vieira vs. Roy Keane rivalry played out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Franz-Beckenbauer-Johan-Cruyff-.jpg><p>Both had strong personalities and captained two of English football’s most powerful forces at the time, Arsenal and Manchester United. The infamous incident in the Highbury tunnel, where Roy Keane and Vieira were shouting in each other’s faces before being separated by the referees, will live long in the memory.</p><p>Their presence also heightened the Arsenal-Manchester United rivalry. Keane and Vieira both had high expectations of themselves. Keane had previously won the European treble with Manchester United and was a serial winner under Sir Alex Ferguson. Vieira led the Arsenal Invincibles to victory.</p><h2>Number 2: Pele – Diego Maradona</h2><p>Until the days of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, most fans agreed that only two players were in contention for the GOAT title. Pele and Diego Maradona were two of those players. Despite playing in completely different eras and never meeting, they share one of football’s most heated rivalries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Roy-Keane-Patrick-Vieira-.jpeg><p>Pele was born in Brazil, and Maradona was born in Argentina. Both countries have a rich football history and are rivals on the field. Both Pele and Maradona led their respective national teams to World Cup victories. While Pele had three victories, Maradona only had one.</p><p>It is important to note, however, that the Brazilian played alongside some of the best in the business. Maradona accomplished this feat with a rather ordinary Argentine team. During Maradona’s rise, he began to be compared to Pele. Maradona beat Pele to the FIFA ‘Player of the Century’ award in 2000.</p><p>Pele was presented with the ‘FIFA Football Family Award. Maradona scoffed at this, saying:</p><p>“Thanks to the fans, I was named Player of the Century in 2000. Pele came in second. He has also voted Brazil’s greatest sportsman, trailing only [Ayrton] Senna. FIFA’s award to Pele isn’t worthy—-.”<br>Both men have fired several shots at each other. Pele has openly chastised Maradona for relying too heavily on his left foot. He also stated that Maradona could only be compared to him after he has scored 1000 goals in football.</p><p>After Pele referred to himself as the “Beethoven of football,” Maradona retorted, saying,</p><p>“Pele has been compared to Beethoven in the world of football. I’ve never heard any Beethoven music in a match, so, as I’ve previously stated, whenever he takes the wrong pill, he makes a crazy statement.”</p><h2>Number 1: Cristiano Ronaldo – Lionel Messi</h2><p>Everything that needs to be said about the greatest football rivalry in history has already been said. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are two of the greatest footballers of all time, and their rivalry has been one of the game’s greatest blessings in recent years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Pele-Diego-Maradona-.webp><p>Messi and Ronaldo were at the pinnacle of their careers while playing for archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, respectively. They monopolized the Ballon d’Or, football’s most prestigious individual award.</p><p>Messi has won the award six times in a row, while Ronaldo has five. During their rivalry, Messi’s Barcelona dominated La Liga, while Ronaldo’s Real Madrid dominated the Champions League.</p><p>Messi and Ronaldo are two of the all-time great goal scorers. Theirs is a complete rivalry in which both players push each other to improve while maintaining a high level of mutual admiration. Both are game icons who have ensured that the GOAT debate will rage on for a long time.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKhdanqovsSaq56rpGK2r7DIr6CdrZGherG4wLKcq2WinsOiuNGinKxn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./french-bulldogs-stolen-california-pet-shop-8418515.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="12 French Bulldogs Valued at $100,000 Stolen from Calif.
