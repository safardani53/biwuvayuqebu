The talk-show host is a proud father to seven children, who have all grown into beautiful and successful adults. Of the seven kids, four are Steve’s biological children from his past marriages to <strong>Marcia Harvey</strong> and <strong>Mary Shackelford</strong>. Steve then married his current wife <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Marjorie Harvey</strong></a>, and he adopted her three children. And from that moment on, Steve was officially a dad of 7!

Broderick said that Steve “wasn’t full time in my life until I was 16,” at which point he moved to Atlanta to live full-time with his father. “At 16, I knew that’s what I needed as a man,” Broderick said on the episode.</p><h2>Wynton Harvey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/steve-harvey-kids-winton-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Steve’s only child from his marriage to Mary, which lasted from 1996 to 2005, is son <strong>Wynton Harvey</strong>, 25.

Fans likely know Lori, who is far and away the most famous of Steve’s seven kids. She is a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>model</a> who has appeared on a number of magazine covers, including Vogue. But Lori really&nbsp;shot to fame thanks to her past relationship with actor <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Michael B. Jordan</strong></a>, 35. The pair started dating around November 2020, and they went public with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the romance</a> in January 2021. Lori even gushed over the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Black Panther</a>&nbsp;actor on&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Real</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>in September 2021, saying, “We just really balance each other. I really do believe in the statement when they say, ‘when you know you know.’ And I think that really applies to our situation and we just have a really good time together.” Sadly, they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>split in June 2022</a>. “Michael and Lori are both completely heartbroken,” an insider told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> at the time. “They still love each other. They had great times together and brought out the best in each other.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Since the breakup, Lori has been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>living her best life,</a> and she’s been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>seen out and about on</a> various occasions. In fact, she began a steamy romance with <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Damson Idris</a>,&nbsp;</strong>and was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>seen out for dinner</a> with him back on December 19, signaling the beginning of the relationship.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>The hunky Snowfall actor <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>confirmed the relationship</a> with a sweet PDA photo in January of 2023. But while the couple has proven almost <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>unimaginably affectionate</a>, in July of 2023, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>speculation of an outside romance</a> threatened their peace. She was spotted at the same restaurant as <strong>Migos</strong> rapper <strong>Quavo</strong> in West Hollywood, but wasted no time nixing the subsequent rumors. Lori left a comment on a fan’s TikTok video, saying, “Lol no I was having lunch with my besties who are right behind me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>She was later seen out to lunch with Damson, and in mid-July, was spotted on a romantic vacation in Saint Tropez with him, per<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Just Jared</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9KtnK%2BdXZ2us8LEsmSkoZSoeqWt1KCfrZ2iYrmwvshma25tY219d3s%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./meghan-markle-is-doing-megxit-because-shes-jealous-of-kate-claim.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meghan Markle is Doing Megxit Because She's Jealous of Kate, Claims Evil Half-Sister">&larr;
