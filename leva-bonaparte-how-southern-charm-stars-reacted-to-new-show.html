So, he definitely came [around].”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Leva-Bonaparte-Southern-Charm-Stars-Werent-Super-Thrilled-New-Show-0001.jpg><p>Leva noted that she and the Sewing Down South founder, 33,<a href=#> have “made amends” since getting into a screaming match on the show’s finale</a>, which aired in September.</p><p>The restauranteur, meanwhile, has been busy focusing on her multiple businesses and filming season 1 of Southern Hospitality — which she teased will feature a few Southern Charm favorites.</p><p>“You’ll see a lot of them make cameos in the show. But I definitely think there were some tricky feelings. Rightfully so,” Leva explained. “I mean some of these people are in the business now for several years and I can see that being tricky.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Mesu co-owner</a> added: “Humans are humans and things get complicated. But I think we’ve all moved on and I think they’re all supportive. What I feel anyway … unless I see them and some other stuff happens, I feel as though they’re all being supportive at this point.”</p><p>The Charleston resident — who <a href=#>joined Southern Charm as a full-time cast member</a> for season 8 after appearing on and off the reality show for years — confessed that she thinks her pals are “rooting” for the show to succeed.</p><p>“I think they understand that this is just very different than Southern Charm. It’s not taking over <a href=#>Southern Charm</a>, it’s not doing anything like that,” she told Us. “Just a very different aspect of Charleston.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Leva-Bonaparte-Southern-Charm-Stars-Werent-Super-Thrilled-New-Show-002.jpg><p>Leva further explained that fans will see “a whole different side” of her and the southern city.</p><p>“I’m very excited for the viewers to have a little bit of fun,’” she said of the spinoff, which will focus on her Republic Garden & Lounge club and the young staff that work there. “I’m really excited for people to laugh and cry and be confused and <a href=#>maybe wanna come visit Charleston</a>. I don’t think anybody’s really sort peeked into the nightclub life. This is a very chaotic business. This is a high liability business.”</p><p>The <a href=#>businesswoman also teased that Bravo viewers</a> will get a better look at her marriage to <a href=#><strong>Lamar Bonaparte</strong></a>, with whom she shares 4-year-old son Lamar Jr.</p><p>“We definitely are hesitant and not just hesitant because, ‘Oh, I’m worried.’ I just think we’re kind of boring,” she told Us. “You might see us argue a bit. We don’t necessarily agree on much of anything except for that we love each other. We definitely are a dog and cat in business. Just very different.”</p><p>Leva confessed: “There’s a fight behind everything. So, you’ll see him sort of step in a little bit. It’s very mom and dad in here. … I’m just hoping that the viewer takes everything with a grain of salt and just enjoys it and knows that at the end of the day it’s a big family over here.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Southern Hospitality premieres on Bravo Monday, November 28, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOerpFir7C6wKmYq6yVYrWww4yspq6smJq%2Fr3nCoZirpV2owaK%2B0mapnpmTqbKledOoZKedp2LAqbvWaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kardashians-rob-proposes-to-all-his-girlfriends-engagement-wont.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rob Proposes To ALL His Girlfriends, Engagement Won't Last!">&larr;
