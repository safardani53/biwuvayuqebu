They think it’s wonderful.</p><p>“The engagement is a lovely surprise. Ali is over the moon.”</p><p>From 2007 to 2012, Alison dated Coronation Street sound technician <a href=#>Adam Huckett</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000512600865-e1565467571356.jpg><p>They have a daughter together and got engaged in Paris in 2011 but split the following year.</p><p>Since then she has gone on to date her new mystery man, pictured with Alison, with the pair being spotted arm in arm on nights out.</p><p>My source said: “Ali has ­obviously endured heartache in the past. But she is hoping those days are now firmly behind her. She is very excited about what the future holds.”</p><p>Clearly love is in the air in <a href=#>Weatherfield</a>, as I also hear Alan Halsall is poised to pop the question to former co-star Tisha Merry, who played waitress Steph Britton.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000493887594.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000493887591.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000487822296-1.jpg><p><a href=#>Tisha and Alan</a> — previously married to <a href=#>Lucy-Jo Hudson</a>, who played Katy Harris — went public with their romance in May.</p><p>They were spotted ­cuddling at the ­wedding of another Corrie cast member — Sam Aston, who plays Chesney Brown.</p><p>And Sam’s nuptials seem to have got Alan thinking about his next move.</p><p>A source close to the actor said: “Alan and Tisha are pretty inseparable. It’s lovely to see them happy. Alan’s closest pals are sure an engagement is right around the corner.”</p><p>Alan, Tisha and his five-year-old daughter with Lucy-Jo are currently on holiday in Greece. The actor, who plays mechanic Tyrone Dobbs, posted two photos on Instagram of them enjoying their luxury resort, captioning one: “#Happiness.”</p><p>With neither of Tisha’s hands visible in the photos, I wonder if she might be sporting a ring already...</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Best moments of soap favourite Alison King as Carla Connor in Coronation Street</span><br><h2>READ ON FOR MORE OF LAURA ARMSTRONG'S BIZ ON SUNDAY COLUMN</h2><h2>Maur blimey!

I’d be an alpha type. When everyone believes ya – what’s that like?” The chorus includes further less-than-glowing comments about Trump’s presidency and his controversial views.</p><p>The record, which is due for release on August 23, includes a heartbreaking song about <a href=#>Taylor’s mum Andrea</a> and her battle with <a href=#>cancer</a>, after the disease came back earlier this year.</p><p>A source said: “During a recent album playback in London, Taylor played the song and had to leave the room. She was in tears. Everyone got pretty emotional.</p><p>“It’s her most personal track ever and a love letter to her mum.”</p><h2>Jamie 'will drop the MIC on Strictly'</h2><p>SAM Prince has backed his <a href=#>Made In Chelsea</a> co-star Jamie Laing to take <a href=#>Strictly Come Dancing</a> by storm.</p><p>Sam told me this week: “I’m sure Jamie is going to absolutely smash it. He’s very charismatic and he’s a great bloke, so I think everyone will love him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000509811356-2-e1565465919520.jpg><p>The pair have remained pals since Sam left the cast of the E4 show last year.</p><p>Jaime, inset, gushed after being unveiled in the Strictly line-up: “The only person potentially more thrilled is my mother. I have finally become the son she hoped for!”</p><p>Sam, who is dating <a href=#>Louis Tomlinson</a>’s sister Lottie, has left behind the glamour of telly to set up his own social media company, The Click Collective.</p><p>He might not spend so much time drinking champagne now but it sounds like Sam has plenty to celebrate.</p><p>Meryl Streep slapped me on the a**e at one point</p><span class=quote-credit>Mamma Mia!

But he wasn’t worried about learning his lines. Speaking at Cats Protection’s National Cat Awards, he said: “I don’t have a particular trick. It just happens to be something I’m really good at.”</p><h2>Iggy's glowing to get noticed</h2><p>WHOEVER is calling Iggy Azalea, it’s not the dull-clothes police.</p><p>The Fancy singer wore this bright-red ball gown in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">photoshoot</a> for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan mag</a>. The Aussie, whose <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">new album In My Defense</a> was out last month, also posed in a pink Barbie-style suit to match her exuberant locks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000511680669.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000511680707.jpg><p>She’ll never get run over.</p><h2>Cara gave wedding clue</h2><p>CARA Delevingne hinted she had <a href=#>tied the knot</a> before her hush-hush wedding was revealed in The Sun on Sunday.</p><p>We told last week how Cara had secretly got hitched to Pretty Little Liars star <a href=#>Ashley Benson</a> in Las Vegas earlier this year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000511607400-2.jpg><p>But the model gave a clue to her newlywed status when she was asked last month in an interview if she was ready to make a lifelong ­commitment to a partner.</p><p>She laughed: “Oh my gosh, yes. I mean, always.”</p><p>Cara also talked about the sexier side of her upcoming Amazon fantasy drama series Carnival Row, which co-stars <a href=#>Orlando Bloom</a>. She said: “The subject matter is serious and very real. It’s death and there’s violence.</p><p>“So if you miss the sexiness, where’s the light? It’s necessary to the storylines.</p><p>“And it’s not objectifying at all. It’s beautiful and amazing.</p><p>“Where would the fun be (without it)?”</p><h2>Liam hoping his career is about to take a dive</h2><p>IF you have ever wondered what to get the man who has everything, <a href=#>Liam Gallagher</a> might have the answer.</p><p>The former Oasis rocker says he wants his latest album Why Me? Why Not to do well because he wants to buy a submarine – presumably a yellow one. And Liam reckons he can get one at a knockdown price. He said: “I am saving up for a submarine, so fingers crossed the album goes well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000507968741.jpg><p>“I’m not sure how much they are (but) I’m sure I could get one on the cheap.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in bizarre</h2></p><p>“I’m going to buy a second-hand one anyway. I like submarines, yeah.</p><p>“They just nip about, you know what I mean? They can’t get you then, can they? People with their selfies and that.”</p><p>When asked why he doesn’t just hide in his car, Liam joked: “No, no, no. I give cars away – in divorces. I collect them and give them to my ex-wife. Aren’t I a nice person?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhxZm6Dd4OXaJqoqp%2BjrrW1zqdkrKyimrK1ecWaraitop7BpnnApaCsp55iuKq6xmacp5%2BRnLKlew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./elf-cast-then-and-now-photos-4251906.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="See Will Ferrell, Zooey Deschanel &amp;amp; More Today  Hollywood Life">&larr;
