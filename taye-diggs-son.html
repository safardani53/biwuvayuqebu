Here's what the 'All American' actor had to say.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Parenthood doesn’t come with a handbook, but <a href=#>Taye Diggs</a> has a few notes to help you along the way. The <a href=#>All American</a> actor welcomed his first child with Idina Menzel in 2009. Years later, the couple ended their marriage and amicably parted ways, but their co-parenting journey was far from over.</p><p>Following their split, Taye faced the reality of being a single father in the digital age, which comes with its fair share of challenges — challenges that ultimately inspired his next big idea. Since he made his Broadway debut in <a href=#>Rent</a> more than two decades ago, Taye has spent the majority of his career on-screen. But now, he’s putting his pen to paper.</p><p>Taye opened up exclusively with Distractify about how his 12-year-old son — Walker Nathaniel Diggs — inspired him to become an author.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Taye Diggs and Idina Menzel’s 12-year-old son inspired the actor’s children’s book series.</h2><p>A wise woman once said that children are our future, and Taye Diggs is inclined to believe her. With this mantra in mind, Taye’s first two children’s books were born.</p><p>​​Both published in 2015, Mixed Me! and Chocolate Me!, center around relevant race issues that affect children of color — including his son, Walker. For the actor, his children’s book series is an opportunity to make it easier for parents to have hard conversations with their children.</p><p>Though, there is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all approach to parenting. And Taye said he learned that lesson first-hand. “He is his own person,” he said of his son. "So I'm constantly having to just watch how he moves and cater how I move with him to his own experience.”</p><p>“I think, today, we can easily get caught up in thinking there's one way to raise all children,” he added.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>He also drew inspiration for his books from his own childhood. The actor attended a prep school in Rochester, N.Y., before he transferred to School of the Arts. It was there that Taye said he "was able to blossom.”</p><p>"Growing up, I was very nerdy. I was not part of the popular group," the All American actor shared. "And it wasn't until I transferred to School of the Arts when my mother noticed some talent. At that school, I was able to focus on what made me different."</p><p>Taye’s love for literature runs deep, which is exactly why he teamed up with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucky Charms</a> for National Read Across America Day.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Taye Diggs (@tayediggsinsta)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Join Taye Diggs for a read-along of Lucky the Leprechaun’s ‘The Magic Inside’ on Instagram Live.</h2><p>On March 2, Taye will appear on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram Live</a> for a reading of Lucky the Leprechaun’s new book, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Magic Inside</a>. In it, kids are introduced to Lucky’s family, who — unlike him — are human. The tale is one of self-acceptance in spite of what makes you different, and Taye definitely approves that message.</p><p>However, according to the actor, the message in The Magic Inside isn’t just for children. In fact, Taye himself can relate to Lucky's new book on a personal level. “I'm huge on self-esteem and embracing your differences and helping them make you stronger,” Taye told Distractify.</p><p>“I think people are never too old to be reminded how special that is," he added.</p><p>The read-along starts at 8 p.m. EST on Wednesday, March 2, 2022.
