having been <a href=#>gripped by its worst murder toll in more than a decade</a> that saw more than 140 killed.</p><p>However, the capital topped the list when it came to thefts and robberies with 49.6 violent thefts per 1,000 people recorded, five more than last year.</p><p>In just one example of this,&nbsp;Arsenal star <a href=#>Mesut Ozil, 30, fell victim to a dramatic attempted hijack with his teammate Sead Kolasinac, 26, in North London.</a></p><p>Meanwhile in a violent attack, a lesbian couple <a href=#>were left bloodied after being set upon while on a London bus in June</a> - with three teens aged just 15, 16 and 17 admitting to targeting the women.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">LONDON'S BLOODIEST YEAR: Knife epidemic sparks bloodshed in capital</h3></p><p>THERE have now been more than 140 violent killings in London - with no sign of the horrific bloodshed ending.</p><p>The capital's murder toll has surpassed the horrific 137 killed in 2018, which had been the bloodiest year in a decade.</p><p>In December alone, there was a shocking spree of six brutal murders just before Christmas.</p><p>Tragically, 21&nbsp;teens have been killed in the capital this year, 19 of whom were fatally stabbed.</p><p>Richard Taylor, 70, father of Damilola Taylor, who was 10 when he was stabbed to death in 2000, said: "This is nothing but a national crisis.</p><p>"Some teenagers see either being murdered or killing another person as a rite of passage when that used to be getting a job or going to university."</p><p>This year's death toll devastatingly started on New Year's Day when mum-of-one Charlotte Huggins, 33, was knifed to death at her home in Camberwell, South East London.</p><p>Just hours later security guard&nbsp;<a href=# data-mce-href=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8102288/bouncer-stabbed-new-years-eve-hyde-park-moved-uk-better-life/>Tudor Simionov, 33, was stabbed outside a VIP sex party in Park Lane, Mayfair</a>.</p><p>A week later&nbsp;<a href=# data-mce-href=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8196322/murdered-teenager-jaden-moodie-police-appeal/>Jaden Moodie</a>, 14, was stabbed to death in East London after being knocked off a moped.</p><p>One of the reasons why violence in the capital has spread is&nbsp;<a href=# data-mce-href=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9442061/kids-seven-traffic-drugs-county-lines-gangs/>because of the brutal “county lines trade” where urban dealers force children and other vulnerable people to take drugs to customers in more rural areas</a>.</p><p>The National Crime Agency estimate there are more than 1,000 “county lines” in operation – a 40 per cent rise in just one year – raking in an estimated £1.8billion annual profit.</p><p>Each county lines route is making as much as £5,000 a day - £7million between them all.</p><p>The county lines gangs regularly entice boys, largely from broken homes, into a life of crime with promises of money, kudos and a sense of belonging often lacking in their troubled home lives.</p><p>In London itself, gang warfare is increasingly being driven by a ruthless battle to control the drugs market in a move away from “postcode wars”.</p><p>Middle class cocaine users have come under fire for helping to fuel this increasingly violent battle in Lawless London.</p><p><a href=# data-mce-href=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5914873/cressida-dick-resign-partner-replacement/>Cressida Dick</a>, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, said the growing demand from well-off users for the Class A drug was leading to a surge in violent gang crime.</p><p>London was also gripped by yet another terror attack this year <a href=#>with two people killed when Usman Khan, 28, unleashed a bloody knife rampage.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Terror attacks are not included in the Home Office statistics.</p><p>Meanwhile, North Wales remains the sex offence hotspot of England and Wales, followed by Kent and West Yorkshire.</p><p>One of the worst attacks to grip Britain was that at the hands of sicko Joseph McCann, <a href=#>who was given 33 life sentences after being convicted of a series of rapes and kidnappings against 11 women and children from London to Cheshire.</a></p><p>Twisted McCann wore wigs, told victims he loved them and claimed they were part of a "gypsy initiation ritual" as he carried out a horrific rape spree across the UK.</p><p>The Ministry of Justice has since launched an investigation into just why he had not been recalled to prison earlier.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AF-GRAPHIC-Sex-Offences.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AF-GRAPHIC-Criminal-Damage-Arson.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AF-GRAPHIC-Robbery.jpg><p>Other areas where people are at risk of theft include Cleveland, Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire.</p><p>Theft offences in Wales are more than 35 times less likely than in the capital.</p><p>The findings are proportional to the amount of people living in each force's area.</p><p>In the wake of the figures, West Yorkshire Police Temporary Asst Chief Constable Mark Ridley <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">told Examiner Live:</a> "We as a force have experienced real rises in violent crime, burglary and robbery, similar to other forces nationally. Conversely we have seen a reduction in other areas of crime including vehicle crime and theft from the person.</p><p>"We have experienced some of the worst cuts to our budgets when compared to other forces nationally at a time when criminality is not only increasing, but evolving in terms of seriousness and complexity and at a time when we have seen unprecedented increases in calls for service to our 999 and 101 system .</p><p>"Please be assured that the victim remains at the heart of all that we do. Protecting vulnerable people and attacking criminality together with reducing crime and providing value for money remain a priority for the force."</p><p>Dyfed-Powys in Wales is the safest place to live with 47.2 offences per 1,000 people taking place – meaning West Yorkshire residents are more than twice as likely to be a victim of a crime.</p><p>Other rural areas such as Gloucestershire, Devon and Cornwall and Wiltshire are also among the least crime-hit areas.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>Police Scotland figures are published separately by the Scottish government and aren't directly comparable with the Home Office statistics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/RR-MUZZ-12.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000508749998.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Deontay Wilder hails fighting skills of Sead Kolasinac after watching video of Arsenal star confronting moped gang</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZn12hI9wam5nlJa7qLHRqKysZZGjsW6%2FwJ%2BcrKxdpbmir8SsZKWhppp6prrGpZinnF2srq2x0mg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-lisa-niemi-patrick-swayze.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Lisa Niemi? | The Sun">&larr;
