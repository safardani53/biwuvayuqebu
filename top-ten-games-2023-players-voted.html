Drawing From Memory</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/drawing-from-memory.png><p><strong>User Score: 9.0 / Critic Score: N/A</strong></p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="More in Gaming">More in Gaming</h2><p>Drawing From Memory doesn’t have enough critics reviews for a critic score, but fans have been loving it.</p><p>It’s one of those games that streamers play with fans, and everyone laughs at their terrible drawings.</p><p>As the name suggests, you and your friends are challenged to draw a famous character from memory, and then you can vote for the best one.</p><p>The obvious aim is to laugh at how bad everyone’s drawings are, and that’s what makes it so fun.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Gaming</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Pikmin 4</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/pikmin-4-glhf-18.png><p><strong>User Score: 9.0 / Critic Score: 87</strong></p><p>Critics and users more or less agree on this one, as Pikmin 4 won Best Strategy Game this year.</p><p>Bringing more people into the genre, it moves strategy away from traditional wars and focuses on the cute Pikmin.</p><p>Fans of the franchise love it, new players love it, and it’s the biggest and best Pikmin yet.</p><p>It also came out with remasters for the first two games, giving everyone a chance to dive into the series.</p><p>You can read our full <a href=#>Pikmin 4 review</a> here.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. RoboCop: Rogue City</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/robocop.png><p><strong>User Score: 9.0 / Critic Score: 72</strong></p><p>RoboCop divided critics, with many underwhelmed with what was on offer.</p><p>Players have really taken to it though, saying it captures the vibe of the movies perfectly.</p><p>Some people just enjoyed running around the world shooting up the city, and they didn’t need anything more.</p><p>RoboCop was unsurprisingly a hit with RoboCop fans, and I guess that’s all it needs to be.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Marvels-Spider-Man-2_20231003190657.jpg><p><strong>User Score: 9.1 / Critic Score: 90</strong></p><p>As one of the most highly-anticipated games of the year, fans were very pleased with it when it was finally released.</p><p>You are able to play as both Peter Parker and Miles Morales for the first time, and there are a whole number of new villains.</p><p>It has a strong continuation of the story and a satisfying conclusion while still offering surprises.</p><p>On top of it all, it’s a great playground to swing around like Spider-Man in.</p><p>You can read our full <a href=#>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 review</a> here.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Scramballed!</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/scramballed.png><p><strong>User Score: 9.1 / Critic Score: N/A</strong></p><p>Much like Drawing From Memory, critics didn’t review this party game.</p><p>It’s another fun game to play with friends, where you play as chickens hitting eggs at each other.</p><p>Best played as couch co-op, it’s the fast-paced play that makes this one so fun.</p><p>It is definitely a more niche game, but one that is great in a group.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Star Ocean: The Second Story R</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/STAR_OCEAN_THE_SECOND_STORY_R_PUB02_P08_01_en.png><p><strong>User Score: 9.1 / Critic Score: 86</strong></p><p>This is a remake of one of the Star Ocean games originally released on PS1, and it was well-received by fans.</p><p>It used a gorgeous art style similar to the HD-2D style of games like Octopath Traveler or Live A Live.</p><p>It’s been a long time since Star Ocean has been in the mainstream, and fans were excited to see it back.</p><p>Nostalgia is a powerful drug and people were happy to see it back.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Super Mario Bros. Wonder</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/super-mario-bros-wonder-glhf-3.jpg><p><strong>User Score: 9.2 / Critic Score: 92</strong></p><p>Players and critics exactly agree on this one, as Super Mario Bros. gave Nintendo fans hope again.</p><p>Wonder brought back the 2D platforming that the series was built on in a spectacular fashion.</p><p>Adding new mechanics, and making cute little animations, it feels like one of the best Mario games to date.</p><p>It has easier levels for younger players, but is a good challenge for those who look for it.</p><p>You can read our full <a href=#>Super Mario Bros. Wonder review</a> here.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Resident Evil 4 Remake: Separate Ways</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/leon-resident-evil-4.png><p><strong>User Score: 9.2 / Critic Score: 88</strong></p><p>The base game for the remake only got a 7.9 from users, and it seems they appreciated it more with the Separate Ways update.</p><p>People felt that Separate Ways should have been included in the base game, like it was with the originals.</p><p>However, when the DLC update came people were satisfied with it, and gave the game as a whole a more generous score.</p><p>The Resident Evil 4 Remake received plenty of nominations for Game of the Year, so it makes sense that it’s high on this list.</p><p>You can read our full <a href=#>Resident Evil 4 remake review</a> here.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. WarioWare: Move it!</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Switch_WWMI_Wario-Stage_SCRN_01.jpg><p><strong>User Score: 9.3 / Critic Score: 75</strong></p><p>Critics were far harsher on WarioWare than the fans, as party games tend to do better with the public at large.</p><p>This Move It! is weirder and wilder than WarioWare games from the past, allowing more people to connect than ever before.</p><p>It uses all of the Switch’s mechanics in order to create fun microgames in a way other consoles couldn’t.</p><p>These games have their own passionate fanbase, which is likely why it received such a high score.</p><p>You can read our full <a href=#>WarioWare: Move It! review</a> here.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Slay the Princess</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/slay-the-princess.png><p><strong>User Score: 9.6 / Critic Score: 92</strong></p><p>While Slay the Princess isn’t as well known as it should be, it landed near the top of both players’ and critics’ best game lists.</p><p>It is one of the games where the less you know, the better it will be, so we don’t want to spoil it here.</p><p>Slay the Princess has beautiful pencil-drawn graphics and a dark twist that keeps people playing.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>It will stay with you long after you finish, which is likely why it received such high scores.</p><p>Written by Georgina Young on behalf of <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">GLHF</a>.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">All the latest Gaming tips and tricks</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Blog-templates-workspace.png><p class=article__content--intro>Looking for tips and tricks across your favourite consoles and games?
