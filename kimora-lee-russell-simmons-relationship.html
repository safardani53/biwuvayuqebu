I was always a daddy's girl. You can see that in any picture.</p><p>"But he's been awful to me for years and that's just the truth.</p><p>"Dad, I stopped talking to you because you were giving me panic attacks to the point I was placed on emergency medication every time we spoke.</p><p>"I cannot have a relationship with you until that stops. No one stops me from talking to you, my health does. I have to put that first."</p><p>As Kimora reposted Aoki's recollection of events to her own Instagram story, the youngest daughter continued: "You were putting so much anger and rage on me every phone call.</p><p>"Cursing and screaming and god knows what else. I'm sorry but I cannot be the target of that it's not fair.</p><p>"Some of us do think he is mentally ill or experiencing something like dementia.</p><p>"He really acts like he hates and does not know his children frequently."</p><p>Kimora came to both of her daughters' defense and commented: "No one should live like this. No one's child."</p><p>The trio also shared a muted video of Russell yelling into a camera; the video is believed to be a personal clip directed at either Ming Lee or Aoki Lee.</p><p>"This is abuse. Not ok. The threats. Not ok. The fear mongering, not ok," Kimora stated.</p><p>"This is how you maneuver with the world and women all around you.</p><p>"Your threats and lies and intimidation maneuvers and tactics are sad. Your own flesh and blood? Enough is enough."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Days later on Tuesday, June 20, Russell replied: "DEEPLY sorry for being frustrated and yelling . . . but know this . . . there are no conditions . . . for sure i love you guys more than i love myself.</p><p>"You read my books and heard me preach your whole childhood . . . reach back to old lessons and remember to remember 'smile and breathe' 'smile and breathe' . . . you are the watchers of this world . . . so let go . . . be at ease . . .
