Sure, it's being kind of nosy, but sometimes you just can't help it! Who doesn't love love?&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, it's only possible to fawn over a star and their romantic relationships when you know about them. There are definitely some celebs out there who keep their dating life pretty private, which is totally fair. A star who has kept her love life very low-key is singer and songwriter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alessia Cara</a>. But that's where we come in for the investigative work!&nbsp;</p><p>So, if you want to know more (or anything) about who Alessia is dating, stick around.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Alessia Cara dating?</h2><p>The 24-year-old Canadian-bred pop star has usually stayed hush-hush when it comes to what's going on in her life outside of music. She rose to fame back in 2014 when her single "Here" became a viral hit. And that was just the beginning of it all for her. Then she embarked on her first headline tour, dropped albums, and continued to break music records. To top it all off, Alessia was the first Canadian to win the Grammy for Best New Artist in 2018.</p><p>Clearly, Alessia has been busy checking off boxes and rising to the top. Though, people may wonder if she's made time for a special someone in her life. Well, in 2016, Alessia was romantically linked to musician Kevin Garrett. Kevin — who is now 29 years old — opened up for Alessia on her “Know It All” tour that same year. Per his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, Kevin is a Grammy award-nominated artist (for his work on Beyoncé's album "Lemonade"), multi-instrumentalist, and producer.</p><p>And the same year they toured together, they posed on the red carpet together at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards. Look how cute they look!&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The two never really posted anything about one another on their social media, but this photo was pretty much enough confirmation that they were a couple — or most definitely seeing each other at the least. Celebrities just don't walk the carpet with just anyone.</p><p>But it seemed like things ended with them in 2018 when she was doing press for her second album, "The Pains of Growing," and she told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a> that she was single. “Oh, my God, no, I’m not even thinking about [dating] right now. That’s the last thing on my mind,” she told the news outlet.</p><p>She went on to say, “Right now is just a period where I wanna think more about myself because I don’t think I’ve ever had the chance to do that [with] my career. Giving so much of myself to a bunch of different people, I’ve never had that time for me, so I think I’m gonna take advantage now.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by ALESSIA CARA (@alessiasmusic)</a></p></figure><p>Alessia also told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan Seacrest</a> that same week in 2018 that she had written a song on that album about "someone."&nbsp;</p><p>"The song ‘Not Today’ … it’s extremely personal. I open up about things I’ve never opened up about like going to therapy and crying on the bathroom floor about someone … I think it’s important to be honest even though it feels a little naked," she told On Air With Ryan Seacrest.</p><p>It's not confirmed when or why she and Kevin may have broken up.</p><p>Back to present day, it looks like she's currently single. Though, again, it's hard to know. She could very much have a secret boyfriend that she'll reveal one day. If Shailene Woodley can date and get engaged to Aaron Rodgers in hiding, anything can happen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJqklajAqq2MnJirmV2ZrrW1zaA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./devorah-roloff-19970617-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Devorah Roloff (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr;
