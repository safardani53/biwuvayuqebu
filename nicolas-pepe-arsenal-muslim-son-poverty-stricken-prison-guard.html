Beware.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000491488527.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Liverpool are set to battle Premier League rivals Arsenal and Chelsea for Lille winger Nicolas Pepe</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX26CeoOTbGdoppmYvK2t0mannqiVYq6zv8SnmKVlnarArbXMZqqopl2lvLex0a2wZqukp7akt8SnZKmqmai8r3nGrpirnF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./b-scott-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="B.
