Charlie opened up about playing siblings together, and joked that they told the casting director that they were siblings when they went in on<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> The Kelly Clarkson Show</a>. “They used to do improv auditions. So Mary Elizabeth and I went into the audition and told them that we were brother and sister, and then, we started making out in the audition,” he said. “They were like, ‘We have to cast them!'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/charlie-day-Mary-Elizabeth-Ellis-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Aside from their Reno 911 appearance, Mary has appeared in 36 episodes of It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia&nbsp;as the waitress that Charlie’s character is head over heels for! “Anytime I’m writing something, I’m thinking, ‘Gosh, I gotta find something great for Mary Elizabeth to do,’ because she’s the best,” Charlie said in a 2019 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>MeAww.</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>When asked if she got tired of working with her husband, Mary admitted that, “Nobody makes me laugh like Charlie” to&nbsp;AfterBuzz.</p><h2>They Got Married In 2006</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Charlie and Mary have been married for 17 years!
