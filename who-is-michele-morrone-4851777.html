The episode, filmed in Sept. 2022, featured Kim working on her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dolce & Gabbana fashion show</a> in Milan. She found out that <strong>Michele Morrone</strong> was going to be at the show and decided to devise a plan <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>to set him up</a> with Khloe, who had been single since ending things with&nbsp;<strong>Tristan Thompson</strong> in Dec. 2021.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>When the fashion show was taking place in real-time, Khloe and Michele set the Internet abuzz when a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photo of them together</a> went viral. Fans will finally get to see Khloe and Michele’s first meeting until the June 22 episode of The Kardashians. Since this happened several months ago, though, we already know that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>nothing further came</a> of this. “He was asked to take a photograph with her,” Michele’s rep said in September. “He thought she was lovely. That is all that happened.” Learn more about Michele below!</p><h2>Where is Michele Morrone From?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Born on October 3, 1990, Michele hails from the town of Reggio Calabria in southern Italy. The acting bug caught him at an early age, and he was inspired to pursue it as a career after seeing&nbsp;Harry Potter at age 10 or 11. He started visiting the local theater in his hometown as a teenager, but couldn’t afford to take acting classes in Italy. He went to college and moved to Rome, where he continued to pursue an acting career.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I found a small job building parquet floors,” he shared with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>, of his early days in the city. “But my first acting job, I booked the first part I auditioned for in a beer commercial. The funny thing is, that the company uses people, but then they transform it into animation. So I was excited to book it and for people to see me in it, but I was a cartoon and no one recognized me.”</p><h2>Is Michele Morrone In A Relationship?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>When Michele was set up with Khloe he was fully single and said he was focused on his career and children. Since then, though, he has found love. Since the beginning of 2023, Michele has been linked to <strong>Moara Sorio</strong>. It’s unclear exactly when they started dating, but they haven’t been shy about showing off their love while out and about in recent months. Photos have surfaced of them holding hands in Italy and more amidst their budding romance.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Michele was previously married to&nbsp;<strong>Rouba Saadeh</strong>, who is a fashion designer. She currently works for Elie Saab, according to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> page. Michele and Rouba got married in 2014, but wound up divorcing in 2018. The two appear to be on friendly terms these days, though. In March 2023, Michele and Moara were <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photographed meeting up</a> with Rouba in Italy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/michele-morrone-5-things-to-know-ss-embed.jpg><h2>Does Michele Morrone Have Kids?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Michele and Rouba had two kids together when they were married. The two are proud parents of sons&nbsp;<strong>Marcus</strong>, 9 and&nbsp;<strong>Brando</strong>, 6.. “I love spending time with my kids,” he told PEOPLE magazine in June 2022. “Being a dad is one of the most amazing things life can give you. We love to go to the beach and just relax, play, or I’ll grab my guitar and start making music.”</p><h2>What Has Michele Morrone Starred In?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Once he booked his first commercial, Michele began landing small roles in Italian television shows starting in 2015. His breakout role, though, was in the 2020 Netflix movie 365 Days, which gave him overnight success. The movie went on to produce two sequels in 2022:&nbsp;365 Days: This Day and&nbsp;The Next 365 Days. “It was a major turning point in my life,” he said in the PEOPLE interview. “Before the movie came out I had 4,000 followers on Instagram. And the night after the movie was released on the platform, I woke up and had 2.6 million followers.”</p><h2>Michele Morrone Is Also A Singer</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>In addition to acting, Michele has also showcased his talents as a musician. He started playing guitar when he was 25 years old after watching YouTube videos. He released his first album,&nbsp;Dark Room, in 2020, and several of the songs are featured on the&nbsp;365 Days&nbsp;soundtrack.</p><h2>Michele Morrone Speaks 3 Languages</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>As if he didn’t already have enough talents, Michele is also trilingual, speaking English, Italian and Arabic. Of course, Italian was his first language, and he learned Arabic due to his ex-wife being Lebanese, with his two children now living there. As for learning English, that came after he realized his career passions. “I wanted to become a working actor but I didn’t want to just stay in Italy,” he explained. “I had to learn English by myself because I really wanted to to work in the States. You have to know English to work over there.” He learned from watching movies and reading in English.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K6qq%2FHnqOeZZ2kv7O7zZ5kbXBlZoR4g44%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./carrie-dejong-brown-19930825-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Carrie Dejong-Brown (YouTube Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr;
