James was born on December 16, 2014, and he is now seven years old. Reynolds revealed to The MR PORTER Post that his oldest daughter was named after his father, who died soon after she was born.&nbsp;When Taylor Swift was two years old, James made a cameo appearance on her album Reputation. Lively revealed on Good Morning America that she and Reynolds were ecstatic about their daughter’s inclusion in the album:</p><p>“We were quite humiliating. This is our real, unvarnished stage-parent pride.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Blake-Lively-And-Ryan-Reynolds.jpg alt="Blake Lively And Ryan Reynolds" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>James is the toddler whose voice can be heard at the start of Taylor Swift’s song Gorgeous.&nbsp;Inez, Reynolds and Lively’s second child, was born on September 30, 2016, and is now five years old. When asked about her name, Lively told People:</p><p>“I had a new baby, Inez, with a ‘z,’ even though everyone insists it’s with an’s.’ Please inform Wikipedia.”</p><p>Reynolds revealed on Live with Kelly and Ryan that Inez is “super into villains” that her favorite character in Beauty and the Beast is Gaston, and that she was the only member of their family who received a “secondary security pat down at 2 years old.” Ryan also revealed that their pediatrician once referred to Inez as “shady.”&nbsp;Betty, Lively and Reynolds’ third child, was born on October 4, 2019. The two-year-name old’s is a family monicker, according to Lively, and was first publicized publicly by Taylor Swift, who released a song named Betty after her birth.</p><h2>Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively discuss parenthood.</h2><p>Blake Lively’s pregnancy announcement comes after she opened up about becoming a mother-of-three in a May interview with Forbes, saying that having children helped her “feel so much more in her skin.”</p><p>“I’ve never felt more myself, at comfortable in my own body, or confident—not to say that I don’t have a million anxieties coming at me every day, but I simply feel extremely content.”</p><p>Ryan Reynolds told LinkedIn News Senior Editor at Large Jessi Hempel in December that he chose to take a break from acting to spend more time with his children because his children are the most important thing to him and he didn’t want to lose out on spending time with them.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Blake-Lively-And-Ryan-Reynolds-2.jpg alt="Blake Lively And Ryan Reynolds" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Deadpool actor also said that he wants to live life “like a regular person” with his children and family:</p><p>“I want my kids to have a fairly regular routine. For many years, when my wife Blake would shoot a film, I would not shoot a film and be with the kids, and vice versa. We never truly worked at the same time, but we were constantly gone, so the kids were away.”</p><p>Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively keep their children primarily out of the spotlight; although Lively’s pregnancy has been announced, the pair has yet to make an official statement regarding the due date.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZpZmbmnqttdWeo7JlkaOxbr7YmqVmqpWuu7C4w6xkmqqVYrK5vMScq6Kml2LBqbHIq2Sfp6KptW6vx6KjnWc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./adopt-a-dog.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Can YOU offer one of these rescue dogs a forever home?">&larr;
