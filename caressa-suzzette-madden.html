She belongs to a white ethnic group.</p><p>Due to Caressa’s private nature, she has not disclosed any information regarding her early life, parents, and siblings.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, she has not shared anything about her educational qualification and background with the public.</p><p>Madden might have graduated from a good university with a good score, but nothing is known.</p><h2>Age And Height&nbsp;</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The beautiful wife of Delonte West was born on May 13, 1988, which makes her 35 </span>years as of now.</p><p>Also, her sun sign is Leo, and&nbsp;from what we know, the people of this sign are ambitious, generous, and loyal.</p><p>Caressa stands 5 feet 6 inches (1.67 m) and&nbsp;has beautiful long black hair and attractive dark brown eyes.</p><p>As we proceed, we will discuss Delonte West and his situation, jumping into her relationship with him.</p><h2>Delonte West</h2><p>West is a former professional basketball player for the NBA and was drafted in the NBA 2004 Draft as a 24th overall pick.</p><p>He has played for the Boston Celtics, Seattle SuperSonics, Cleveland Cavaliers, Fujian Xunxing, Shanghai Sharks, and Dallas Mavericks.</p><p>The athlete, born July 26, 1983, titles his life as “happy-poor.”</p><p>As for his childhood, he lived with many relatives, and during his teenage, he was already engaged in drugs, thus, harming himself.</p><p>As he commenced playing basketball, he was doing quite well with success in his career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Delonte-West.webp><p>However, he struggled with bipolar disorder in 2008. During that time, he went low, which depressed his lifestyle, followed by several incidents and legal cases.</p><p>At the same time, he met his first wife, Kimberly Ashley Awad, and they eloped away to Nevada and married.</p><p>However, their romantic relationship was short-lived, as they broke up within a month of marriage. Following through tragedy and lows, it was when Caressa Suzzette Madden came into his derailed life.</p><h2>How Did They Meet?</h2><p>The duo had a separate life, not knowing anything about each other until late 2012 when they met at a mutual friend’s house party.</p><p>According to the news, from that day on, they were inseparable and started to know about each other.</p><p>Hence, Madden moved into West in Washington’s mansion, where she was pregnant with their first child.</p><p>Despite knowing his hurdles and unemployed condition, Madden did not run away, proving an intimate love for West that goes beyond the universe.</p><p>Simultaneously, the situation was so worse that he couldn’t even afford the heaters, and there was no warm bath in the house.</p><p>Hence, Madden used to create hot baths from the stove.</p><p>During those times, due to Madden’s unconditional love, West was compelled to make the relationship solid by sealing it with marriage.</p><p>Therefore, West cut a string of a jump rope, held it as a ring, and proposed to Madden for marriage.</p><p>He said, “I’m broke. The heat ain’t working, my brain ain’t working right, but I love you.”</p><h2>Marriage, Kids & Net Worth</h2><p>With these, Madden was overtaken by feelings, thus, accepting his proposal despite the situation.</p><p>Later, the couple married in 2013 and had their first son, <strong>Cash West, </strong>when she was 25.</p><p>Following it, in 2014, the couple was blessed with another child, and things slowly fell into place.</p><p>Their life took a steady turn, and they lived in a<strong> $1 million</strong> house with a stunning view of the Potomac. It had eight bedrooms with a luxury swimming pool.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Madden-and-West-with-their-son-e1606548616105.jpg><p>As he went on into his gameplay, he had to stop due to a hairline fracture in his left hand; thus, making things worse, he had the greatest downfall of<strong> $16 million</strong> to <strong>$1000</strong>.</p><p>Before Suzzette, his finance was all gone in a divorce settlement with his first wife and another half in his drug addiction.</p><h2>Delonte West And LeBron James</h2><p>In NBA, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LeBron James</a> is known by everyone; until&nbsp;2016, West and James played together, and everyone loved them going well with each other.</p><p>Unfortunately, the pair has been off since the rumors circulated that West was sleeping with James’ mother. All in all, the West has bipolar disorder, making it harder to get on together.</p><p>In the same year, in 2016, West, in his hospital gown, was seen wandering in a parking lot. Right then, a fan spotted him asking if he was Delonte West, to which he responded,</p><p>“I used to be, but I’m not about that life anymore.”</p><p>This was when his brother Dmitri made a statement saying he had just overdosed on drugs and had no bipolar.</p><p>He continued, “My family is trying to get him the best professional help out there, the best they can afford.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Delonte West 2020</h2><p>Recently mid-2020, in September, West was seen on Dallas Street begging and asking for help. Before this incident, the internet was taken by storm when he was beaten on a Washington, DC, highway.</p><p>Overall, it’s clear how saddening and tragic his life has turned, and there is no information regarding Suzzette at the very moment.</p><p>Nothing is on about how she is holding, where she is, or even her children. We hope she is doing fine and the children are all well.</p><p>Returning to Delonte West after seeing him helpless in the street, many fans retweeted and tweeted the posts and pictures questioning the NBA.</p><p>Fortunately, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban was quick to react, trying to contact West’s mother, thus going in for West’s search.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Delonte-West-1024x576.jpg><p>After days of trying to get in contact, he finally met West and met his mother, Addison. Together, West was taken to Florida to the rehabilitation center.</p><p>On September 28, 2020, Mavericks owner Mark Cuban picked up West from a gas station after photographs spread of him panhandling at a junction in Dallas, Texas.</p><p>Cuban paid for West’s drug rehab therapy and supplied him with a hotel room. West has a job at the recovery center where he checked in and has reconciled with his mother, according to sources on January 19, 2021.</p><p>In July 2022, as noted by <a href=# rel=noopener>Sportskeeda</a>, the additional footage showed West begging again, this time in Virginia.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Caressa Suzzette Madden is not active on social handles. She is not precisely what you would call tech-savvy and was on Twitter in 2012.</p><h2>Search Graph</h2><p>Delonte’s downfall was heartbreaking, and the current condition, according to sources, is also not a humble state to live in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Delonte-West.jpg><p>His search graph’s increase rate can be justified by his viral panhandling video, which made his fans from basketball days worry for his well-being.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQS)</h2><h3>Where is Caressa Suzzette Madden now?</h3><p>Caressa was with Delonte through all the ups and downs. However, her whereabouts in the present is unknown. According to sources, Caress has reportedly moved back to her hometown with her mother and children. But it is unconfirmed news. Well, we hope Caressa soon makes a public appearance.</p><h3>Where are Delonte West's children?</h3><p>As we know, West has been seen panhandling and was alone, helpless, wandering even after the help provided by the Mavs owner, Mark Cuban. Therefore, we can only see the kids with his wife, Caressa Suzzette Madden.</p><h3>How is Delonte West doing?</h3><p>According to the sources, Delonte was undergoing his first training phase in Florida's rehabilitation center. However, in July 2022, additional footage surfaced showing West begging again, this time in Virginia.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCvwKucrKuRYsC2xtmeq62dXaKupbDEp2Y%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chloe-grace-moretz-sets-aside-khloe-kardashian-feud-to-endorse-h.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chloe Grace Moretz Sets Aside Khloe Kardashian Feud to Endorse Hillary Clinton">&larr;
