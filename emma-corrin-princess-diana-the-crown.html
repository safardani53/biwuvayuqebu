After she learned that she would be a part of the popular Netflix series, she wanted to take time to soak it in.</p><p>"I wanted to sort of bury myself under a carpet for a long time and sort of process it," she told Jimmy Kimmel. "That still hasn't really happened. I tried to absorb as much information like a sponge."</p><p>Though Emma made her transformation into Princess Diana seem easy and seamless, she shared that she did a lot of work to nail the voice and accent.</p><p>"To be honest, the person who helped me the most with this was my mum because she's a speech therapist," Emma added. "She was amazing and helped me with my auditions when I was prepping for them. She was great."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Emma's mother would advise her about the lilt in Princess Diana's voice.</p><p>"She would give me tips on the voice, initially, before I started working with William Conacher, who was the main voice and dialect coach I worked with. Yeah, my mum would help me."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>All of the voice coaching ended up working out in Emma's favor.
