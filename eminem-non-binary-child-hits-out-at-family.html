I never wanted this day to come, Eric is a huge part of me and our children.</p><p>"Anyone that knows Eric knows that he's always battled w demons. Anyone that knows Eric knows how phenomenal he was too in so many ways. [sic]</p><p>"I love Eric w every ounce of me he was my best friend no matter what! Eric has made some sh***y choices in life but who hasn't! I have yet to meet a perfect person."</p><p>Hartter had a long rap sheet, with crimes including a felony contraband involving Fentanyl and methamphetamine, to which he pleaded guilty and served time.</p><p>Stevie's social media accounts were flooded with positive comments after they came out as non-binary, and they have had support from their family.</p><p>In one post, they wrote out their pronouns, telling followers: "call me stevie (they/she/he)," which was liked by&nbsp;<a href=#>sister Hailie Jade</a>, Eminem's biological daughter with Kim.</p><p>A&nbsp;video also shows their transformation over the years, with the words: "Watch me become more comfortable with myself," and "forever growing and changing."</p><h2>TROUBLED FAMILY LIFE</h2><p>They used the hashtags #genderfluid #bi and #nonbinary in several posts.</p><p><a href=#>Eminem</a> raised his child, along with Hailie, now 25, and&nbsp;<a href=#>adopted daughter Alaina</a>, 28, whose mother is Kim's late twin sister Dawn who died of a drug overdose in 2016.</p><p>In his song Going Through Changes, Eminem raps: "Hailie, this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too / I still love your mother, that'll never change."</p><p>The TikTok post about their biological dad was shared just days ago, following the death of their beloved grandmother, Kathleen Sluck, who passed away aged 65 following a long period of ill health.</p><p>Stevie's name was referenced in an obituary late last month, which read: "Kathleen was a exceptional mom to her two daughters; Kim and Dawn; and was overjoyed to become a grandmother to her grandchildren; Alaina, Adam, Hailie, Stevie, P.J., and Parker."</p><p>The Sun obtained Kathy's death certificate, which shows she was pronounced dead at 6.40pm on July 23 at Henry Ford Macomb Hospital in Clinton Township.</p><p>Her death was listed as "natural" due to septic shock, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&nbsp;(COPD), while congestive heart failure also a contributing factor.</p><p>The document shows she was living with her daughter Kim and grandchildren before her death on 22 Mile Road, which was reportedly built by Eminem.</p><p>She was cremated following a funeral attended by family and friends.</p><p>The Sun reported <a href=#>Kathy's death</a> left Stevie's mom heartbroken and she allegedly tried to take her own life just a day after her funeral on July 30, according to TMZ.</p><p>Cops rushed to the 46-year-old's home in&nbsp;Macomb,&nbsp;<a href=#>Michigan</a>&nbsp;on July 30 and she was allegedly combative when police arrived and had to be restrained by deputies, according to law enforcement sources.</p><p>Paramedics were unable to check her vitals, the outlet reported.</p><p>A police report, obtained by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>PageSix</a>, said she was sitting on her bathroom floor holding an "unidentified object" and had a "large amount of smeared blood" from "deep lacerations on legs".</p><p>She had "difficulty speaking, was slurring her speech and later fluctuated in various levels of consciousness," the report said.</p><p>It added that there was a small cardboard shipping box filled with "haphazard messages" written out to to her family members, including a "do not resuscitate" request.</p><h2>HEARTBROKEN MOM</h2><p>Kim was reportedly transported to the hospital for both medical and psychological evaluation, before returning home for recovery.</p><p>A user claiming to be Kim previously posted an emotional comment on mom Kathy's online tribute page, writing: "I don't even know where to begin mom!!!
