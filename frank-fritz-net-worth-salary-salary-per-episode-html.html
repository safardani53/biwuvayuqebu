His weekly incursions on TV has made him one rich fellow. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The Iowa Native is known for co-hosting History Channel’s American Pickers - a show about antique collectors and ‘pickers’ who travel to various U.S. cities looking for antique items - along with <a href=# rel=follow>his childhood friend, Mike Wolfe</a>.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>His fondness for antique toys, Hondas, and oil cans have entertained and amused the audiences since the first episode of the show was aired on TV. The show is in its 20th season.</p><p>The show rose as a profit-generating machine in a short period of time starting from 2010. No wonder, the show's stars including Frank and his co-stars <a href=# rel=follow>Mike Wolfe</a>, <a href=# rel=follow>Danny Koker</a>, <a href=# rel=follow>Robbie Wolfe</a> and <a href=# rel=follow>Danielle Colby</a> cash-in millions of dollars combined per season. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Honest Shade:</strong> Frank and Mike explore in search of hidden gems while Nicki Swift reveals their shady sides (Published on 10 June 2018)&nbsp;</p><p>The 53-year-old antique collector has made several TV appearances -&nbsp;Rachel Ray;&nbsp;Late Show With David Letterman;&nbsp;and Pawn Stars to name a few. In 2017, he lent a voice to an episode of animated TV series, American Dad.</p><p>He currently owns an antique shop named Frank Fritz Finds and runs a website of the same name from his office located in Savanna, Illinois. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In his dating life, he is known for <a href=# rel=follow>his relationship&nbsp;with a lady named Diane, a loving grandmother to her daughters' son</a>.</p><h3><strong>Frank Fritz's Bio:&nbsp;Know What He Likes More Than Picking&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Born on 11 October 1965 in Davenport, Iowa, USA, Frank graduated from Bettendorf High School in 1982. Co-incidentally, he and his co-host, Mike Wolfe were classmates at the time of graduation.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>You May Also </strong><strong>Like:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Mike Wolfe On "Ultimate Joy" From Getting Married To Wife! Meet The Wolfe Family</a></p><p>Up until the show, the Bettendorf alumnae hadn’t involved in any business dealings. They were asked by a mutual associate to join forces once their mutual associate learned about a possible joint venture, which would later become American Pickers. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Unlike his co-host Mike, Frank ‘isn’t about that life.’ The 53-year-old has reserved his passion for connections instead. Before joining American pickers, he had minimal experience ‘picking’ antiques and collectibles. His lifestyle in real life is a stark contrast to the life he seems to portray for cameras.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Frank seems to enjoy the experience more than the actual act of picking items. In an interview with Quad-City Times, he said: “The best part is meeting the people. It’s not the stuff. Believe it or not, not everybody has cable. A lot of the people have never seen the show.’’</p><h3><strong>His American Pickers Controversies</strong></h3><p>Detractors of the show accuse Frank and his associate of falsifying the picking business with his net worth thrice that of expectations and preposterous profit margins as a result. Likewise, in a similar incident, a client of him by the name Jerry Burke took him to court for never delivering the polarimeter despite having paid for one. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His trouble hasn’t limited to external forces. In an interview with Quad-City Times&nbsp;in 2013, he accused the city of Davenport of ‘turning’ their back against him. Responding to his comments, his co-host Mike and prime founder of the show,&nbsp;asked him to be ‘proud of where’s from’ in an interview with the same publication. Their growing strife then caused many fans of the show to speculate a possible end to the show, American Pickers.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><strong>More On American Pickers:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Does Danny Koker Has Wife & Kids? Bio Reveals Family Details</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Furthermore, he was also arrested for drunk driving and driving the wrong way on Interstate 80 on July 30th, 2017. He pleaded guilty to the offense&nbsp;which resulted in him getting a hefty fine and a probation order from the court.</p><h3><strong>Frank Fritz Returning To Arkansas With American Pickers</strong></h3><p>It was officially announced on 9 September 2018 that Frank and Mike were returning to Arkansas, the United States, as they plan to film episodes for the new season of the hit series, American Pickers through the whole state in November. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Carrying his immense passion for hunting for valuable items and antiques, Frank has deemed it his mission to bring life to the forgotten relics. As always, Frank and Mike will be meeting new people who'll make appearances on the show as they showcase some rare and exceptional pieces and items.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo is once again hoping to provide historical significance to the objects&nbsp;and value they possess. They'll also be acquiring knowledge about America's past and history along with the antiques. There's no doubt that the show will be a hit once again as it pulls in more and more viewers and fans.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h3><strong>Picking Pays Off: Frank Fritz's Impressive Salary & Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Frank reportedly receives a mind-boggling $500,000 a season in salary from History Channel.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Dissecting his salary, it would mean: he's paid $10,000 salary per episode (Season 18 featured 50 episodes). Other reports suggest that the reality tv star is said to be paid $125,000 for first two episodes of a season and $20,000 per episode for the remainder of the season.</p><p></p><p>Frank, inside his shop, Frank Fritz Find located in Savvanah, Illinois (Photo: travelfuntu.com) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>The 52-year-old has a net worth of $5 million.
