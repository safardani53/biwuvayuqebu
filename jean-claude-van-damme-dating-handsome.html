It was that easy.</p><p>“I think I’m still popular, but I’m a sleeping Van Damme now.”</p><p>Jean-Claude grew up in <a href=#>Brussels</a> with his mum, accountant Eliana, and dad, florist Eugene.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>He found his passion aged ten, when his father enrolled him in karate school.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘I’m an expert in divorce’</h2><p>After years of fighting his way in the martial arts industry in <a href=#>Belgium</a>, he moved to the US in 1982 to pursue acting.</p><p>From then he worked in various jobs until he landed his big break in the 1988 film Bloodsport.</p><p>And fame and fortune was not all that followed.</p><p>The action man reveals how he has battled <a href=#>bipolar disorder</a> and drug addiction but says he has had an amazing life thanks to his love of fitness, dogs and women.</p><p>He has been married five times, to four different women, but along the way he also confesses to numerous affairs.</p><p>Jean-Claude first married personal trainer Maria Rodriguez in 1980 then wed Cynthia Derderian in 1985, which lasted just a few months.</p><p>In 1987, bodybuilder Gladys Portugues became his third wife and they had children Kristopher, now 36, and Bianca, 33, who are both actors.</p><p>He and Gladys divorced in 1992 and then he found his fourth wife, actress Darcy LaPier, who he married in 1994 and had son Nicholas with.</p><p>The 28-year-old is also an actor.</p><p>Yet while Darcy was pregnant, he admits he had a fling with co-star <a href=#>Kylie Minogue</a> during the filming of the 1994 movie Street Fighter in <a href=#>Thailand</a>.</p><p>He says: “It happened. I was in Thailand, we had an affair. Sweet kiss, beautiful love-making.”</p><p>He and Darcy divorced and Gladys, now 66, remarried him in 1999.</p><p>They nearly split up again in 2015 but patched up their relationship and are still married today, living in <a href=#>Los Angeles</a>.</p><p>Laughing, he says: “I am an expert in divorce, because I’ve been divorced four times.</p><p>"You believe in love and you want to lock that down for life. And then you realise that it’s not working.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter whose fault it is.</p><p>"The only medication through a divorce is to try not to yell, stay distant and give yourself time.</p><p>“We have a tendency to think that there’s only one person we can love.</p><p>"But humans have a big energy, which means you can have lots of people you love out there.”</p><p>When he was offered a cameo role on the sitcom Friends in 1996, the lothario was given a part where he would not get to seduce his co-stars.</p><p>His guest appearance during the Super Bowl-themed episode The One After The Super Bowl was with Jennifer Aniston’s character, Rachel, and <a href=#>Courteney Cox</a>’s Monica.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/martial-arts-actor-jean-claude-594149639-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/7f390c40-4b37-497f-a74d-89bb695f24ec.jpg><p>They both end up kissing the action hero and then clashing over his attention, until he suggests a threesome and they dump him.</p><p>Speaking from Belgium while visiting family, Jean-Claude tells us: “I didn’t know much about Friends as I was so busy.</p><p>“I had no idea what a huge show it was.</p><p>“I had no idea who Jennifer Aniston or Courteney Cox were.</p><p>“So I was on the set with Courteney and Jennifer and they came to me and it’s a kissing scene and they kissed me, but I didn’t ask for a kiss.</p><p>"And then the director said, ‘A little more extravagant please’. It was funny.</p><p>“Only later on I found out who Jennifer and Courteney were — after I’d finished filming.</p><p>“I saw them in the magazines and I said to my friend, ‘If I’d known who they were before we started filming I would have kissed them for such a long, long time and I would have done an even better kiss’.</p><p>“But I didn’t know, and since then I’ve never kissed either of them.”</p><p>While on set he also discovered that years of training and strict diet habits, where he eats eight times a day, meant his bottom cheeks were so strong he could crack a nut with them.</p><p>Describing the bizarre party trick, he says: “I was on Friends when I did it and it was a very cool joke.</p><p>“Everyone thought it would be impossible to crack a nut that way, but when you have a strong butt, anything is possible.</p><p>“I used to do ballet dancing, so that helped me a lot with my strength in different types of positions.”</p><p>He said he came up with the idea after being unable to find a nutcracker at his home.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘As good an actor as Pacino or De Niro’</h2><p>“It was a big struggle, but the ballet helped,” he said with a laugh.</p><p>Despite an exciting life, he has faced struggles.</p><p>He had a drug addiction, which at one point led to him spending a staggering £10,000 a week on <a href=#>cocaine</a>.</p><p>The actor also had a lifelong battle with bipolar disorder, which saw him have lows where he would stay at home eating only “carrots and raw cauliflower” and highs where he would party all night.</p><p>Jean-Claude says of his condition: “I have had my ups and downs. I will never be 100 per cent OK.</p><p>“I will have those lows and you have to click off.</p><p>“It’s very hard to go to the gym when you have a low, so when that happens I train with very light weights.</p><p>"That way I still have some movement.</p><p>“I always feel better after I go to the gym. It’s a non-stop battle. It’s a chemical thing.”</p><p>His focus on exercise throughout his life means he can “absolutely” still do a 360-degree karate kick and the splits.</p><p>He says: “It’s cool, because it encourages other people to do stretching and to go to the gym.</p><p>“I trained since I was very young.</p><p>"You release serotonin, this natural happiness, and the more you do it, the more you want it.”</p><p>Neither his workout routine nor career have slowed down.</p><p>In the past year he has starred in the movie Darkness Of Man and family film <a href=#>Minions: The Rise Of Gru</a>.</p><p>Now he is following in the footsteps of his pop singer ex Kylie by having his own alcohol line.</p><p>Jean-Claude co-owns Old Oak Irish Whiskey and despite his buff body, says he loves to drink it.</p><p>He adds: “I have my little whiskey at night, one, two, three times a week. It makes me tipsy.”</p><p>It is all about the little things in life for the Hollywood star, who loves nothing more than curling up with his dogs these days.</p><p>He says: “I now relax with my animals, I’ve got a weakness for animals. I’m crazy about them.</p><p>“I have Lola, I’ve got Mark, I’ve got Indy, I’ve got Nicky, I’ve got Dachca, Macha and Scarface.</p><p>“Altogether at one time I had 11 dogs, including one in a wheelchair, one with three legs, from different countries like Bulgaria. All adopted.</p><p>"They’re the best.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>But he has no plans to put his feet up full-time because he knows exactly what his fans want from him.</p><p>He admits: “I am as good an actor as <a href=#>Al Pacino</a> or <a href=#>Robert De Niro</a> but people will always want to see me kick ass.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/epa00788157-princess-stephanie-monaco-58th-4060948.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NINTCHDBPICT000698070660.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tatum-oneal-attends-best-drag-829701914-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/actor-martial-arts-expert-jean-1843664.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NINTCHDBPICT000858170665.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxZmWBeYOXaKGemZ5isK2t1J2cZq6Ro3qlrcymnGackam2r7OMoZinnKOkuqZ7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kim-kardashian-ate-and-took-phone-calls-during-sex-ray-j-alleges.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kim Kardashian Fixed Makeup, Ate Pizza, Took Phone Calls During Sex with Ray J">&larr;
