They think it could either be eczema or an allergy to milk, but we’re still going through the process of finding out.</p><p>"We’re hoping to find out in the next few weeks exactly what the problem is so he can be treated properly for it but for now, Balmonds has been a godsend for us."</p><p>The mum added that the ordeal has not just been stressful for her and her partner, but also for her other children who were worried about their little brother.</p><p>She added: "They watched us try to find a solution for him and were all just as worried as we were.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"My 11-year-old son Levi was worrying about Caleb and kept saying to me, 'He’s the last baby and he’s having all this trouble, poor thing'.</p><p>"When something like this happens, it affects the whole family, so it’s such a relief for everyone that he’s now on the mend."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NINTCHDBPICT000835466510.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/collect-pa-real-life-835466508-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/c10479de-ffe4-4dcc-9f8e-de3a021ef295.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/collect-pa-real-life-835466517.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/rachel-said-felt-helpless-find-835468179.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/six-hours-applying-cream-rachel-835468093.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXxzf5FwcG1wZ2SypMbEpphmq5ueu265yKuYnKSVYq%2BiuMxmmZqknaS7pb%2BMrKKipl2orq3CwK2gqKZf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./royal-family-tree-queen-elizabeth-kids-and-grandkids-2013107.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Royal Family Tree: A Guide to Queen Elizabeth II's Kids and Grandkids">&larr;
