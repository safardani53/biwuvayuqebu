Some wanted to learn more about the wrestler's <a href=#>cause of death</a>, while others focused more on digging into the details of his life outside of wrestling.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>One of the big questions that many fans of Bray's had following his death was whether he had ever been married. As it turns out, he had, but the marriage didn't end on the greatest terms.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Was Bray Wyatt ever married?</h2><p>Bray Wyatt was married from 2012 to 2017 to Samantha Rotunda. The marriage ended after Samantha filed for divorce, claiming that Bray had cheated on her during the marriage. Samantha works as a real estate agent for Southern Belle Realty, and she has remarried since her divorce.</p><p>Following his marriage to Samantha, Bray was in a long-term relationship with WWE announcer Jojo Offerman, with some speculating that Bray had cheated on Samanta with Jojo. The two were in a relationship right up until the time of his death and got engaged in 2022.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Bray Wyatt have any kids?</h2><p>Bray was a father four times over. He had two children with Samantha: Kendyl, who was born in 2011, and Cadyn, who was born in 2013.</p><p>Samantha eventually accused Bray of estranging these two children following their divorce, and it's unclear whether he was still in touch with them at the time of his death.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In addition to Cadyn and Kendyl, he also had two children with Jojo, even though the two never married. They had a song named Knash in 2019 and a daughter named Hyrie in 2020, and it seems like Bray was a loving father to both of these children, at least based on Jojo's Instagram posts.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Just before his death, it had been announced that Bray was contemplating a return.</h2><p>Bray stepped away from wrestling in February 2023 because of unspecified health issues. We later learned that he had contracted COVID-19, and it had exacerbated existing issues with his heart. Just days before his death, though, it was announced that he was getting close to a potential return to WWE.</p><p>Unfortunately, that return never came to pass. Following the news of his death, though, many well-known wrestlers wrote about the legacy that Bray left behind in the ring.</p><p>His legacy in the ring is undeniable, as the many tributes to him have made clear.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2BixYywsJqspGK6or7Ropyd</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./brad-silberling.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Brad Silberling net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr;
