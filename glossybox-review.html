Signing up to Glossybox would make the dream a reality by delivering a parcel full of makeup and skincare to your door every month.</p><p>The subscription service will send you five products from £11.75 a month, and promises to surprise you with different, perfectly-wrapped goodies from both well-known brands and emerging businesses.</p><p>We tried it out to see if it's worth the money.</p><p><i>If you click on a link in this story we may earn affiliate revenue</i></p><ul><li><strong>Buy a Glossybox subscription from £11.75 - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a></strong></li></ul><h2>Pros</h2><ul><li>Affordable</li><li>Cute packaging</li><li>Mixture of make-up and skincare</li><li>Playful, positive vibes</li><li>Inclusion of lesser known brands</li></ul><h2>Cons</h2><ul><li>You don't get to choose any of the contents of the box</li><li>Less sophisticated than other beauty subscriptions</li></ul><h2>How does Glossybox work?</h2><p>A subscription costs £11.75 a month for 12 months or £13.25 on a rolling monthly basis, and this covers a box of five beauty products; think fun sheet masks, moisturisers, serums, fruity lip balms and little make-up must-haves.</p><p>The Glossybox team are constantly working to discover new brands and give you advice on the "tips, tricks and trends" of the beauty world. The website is always full of influencer-led videos and articles so you'll never be sent anything without info on how to use it.</p><p>The January box was all about 'Mindful Mornings' and was worth over £70 - not bad for a service that costs less than £15 a month.</p><p>Subscriptions can a feel a little permanent, but you can opt out at any time without ever having to commit to more than a month, which is more flexible than other beauty boxes on the market.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG-1704.jpg><h2>Is Glossybox worth it?</h2><p>The January Glossybox arrived in its well known pink box, promising a surprise of skincare and beauty goodies.</p><p>Inside, there was tissue paper that matched the pink of the outer packaging wrapped neatly around the products and a delicately tied ribbon securing it together.</p><p>First impressions were that it had been put together with care which made it feel like a gift rather than a subscription service.</p><p>The January box was all about 'Mindful Mornings' and the products inside reflected that. Ours contained Dr Botanicals Co Cleansing Bar, Glow on 5th Lip Dew Tinted Lip Balm, Eyeko Spotlight Highlighter Pencil in Champagne, Mudmasky Vitamin A Booster Blue Clay Mask and Nails Inc Gel Rehab Strengthening Treatment.</p><p>They were all full size except for the Nails Inc Gel Rehab Strengthening Treatment which is definitely a one up on some similar services.</p><p>The range in this box was good, although the brands were a little lower budget than we expected, with Mudmasky being the only higher value product at £40. Otherwise everything was £15 or less and the only truly recognisable brand for those not in the beauty know was a mini.</p><p>Having said that, once we gave them a go, we did enjoy them.</p><p>Like the Eyeko Spotlight Highlighter Pen in Champagne for example, which was smooth and pigmented, and worked as a sparkling makeup finisher.</p><p>Or the Nails Inc Gel Rehab Strengthening Treatment which did exactly what it said it would and gave nails a healthy boost.</p><p>The Glow on 5th Lip Dew Tinted Lip Balm was definitely January appropriate, soothing dry and chapped lips while adding a whisper of colour but wasn't as long lasting as it could have been.</p><p>In terms of size and price, the most generous offering is the Mudmasky Vitamin A Booster Blue Clay Mask which encourages smoother skin using clay and natural retinol alternative, Bakuchiol.</p><p>If brands aren't the be all and end all for you then the full sizes available in Glossybox will rival any competitor but don't expect designer products.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.thcdn.com/images/large/webp//productimg/1600/1600/13486988-1154931638655097.jpg><h2>Is Glossybox or Birchbox better?</h2><p>For a little pick-me-up with lesser known brands and full sizes, choose Glossybox. If you're looking to try out high-end products before you buy them then opt for Birchbox.</p><p>Birchbox also offers a wide range of skincare and makeup just like Glossybox - think face masks, scalp cleansers and primers - but they're often more luxe.</p><p>Both boxes have variety, but it just depends on what you're after. If you're a skin-care obsessive who's looking for your new favourites then you might prefer Birchbox. However, Glossybox gives you actual full sized products which means you're physically getting more for your money (there's only £1 difference between the two).</p><p>There's a wider range of high and lower-end products in Glossybox too, meaning if you find something you love and want to repurchase individually, they're more budget-friendly.</p><h2>What day does Glossybox arrive?</h2><p>Glossybox dispatch its boxes on the 5th of each month, but it can take up to a week to leave the warehouse and arrive at your door.</p><p>To make sure you know they've got your order, Glossybox will send out a dispatch email telling you your goodies are on their way.</p><p>The boxes are always delivered monthly but it's up to you how you pay for them. If you sign up for 12 months it'll cost you £11.75 a month and for a rolling monthly subscription it is £13.25.</p><h2>What is Glossybox?</h2><p>Glossybox is a beauty subscription service that's delivered to your door from £11.75 a month.</p><p>Whether you're looking for a monthly pick-me-up or want to widen the breadth of your beauty knowledge, this little pink box arriving at your door is a real treat.</p><h2>How to cancel Glossybox</h2><p>If you don't want to get caught int he middle of a payment cycle then axe your Glossybox subscription before the 14th of the month.</p><p>If you leave it past then, the next month's box will be delivered and you'll be charged for it.</p><p>Plus, you're out of luck if you want to cancel a 12 month contract early.</p><p>When you do want to cancel, you can talk to one of the customer care team via the live chat on the site, or click on the account tab and then 'subscriptions'.</p><h2>How much is Glossybox?</h2><p>Glossybox costs £13.25 per month.</p><p>However, you can opt for a 12 month subscription which is just £11.75 a month, saving you £18 a year.</p><h2>When does Glossybox charge?</h2><p>The first subscription fee is taken the moment you sign up if you've opted for a rolling monthly subscription.</p><p>Following that, payments are taken around the 1st of every month.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">more sun selects beauty</h2></p><p>If you enjoyed this review, check out our verdict on the <a href=# rel=noopener>best Olaplex products</a>.</p><p>We also reviewed the <a href=# rel=noopener>ghd Unplugged Straighteners</a>.</p><p>Head to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Sun Selects Beauty</a> for shopping guides, news and deals.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmpsYG6EcYKPaJ6lp6OoxqO712apnq6ZmsRw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jennifer-rosoff-fall-killed-balcony-date-screams.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jennifer Rosoffs Fall  Her Date Screams In Agony After Tragic Accident  Hollywood Life">&larr;
