I wouldn’t say it was a lucky escape but I managed to get things sorted.</p><p>“Mine was stage three, pretty serious. Had I left it a few more weeks, it could’ve been stage four.</p><p>“My eldest son was 18 in January and I got emotional at his party. When I saw family and stepped back, I was like, ‘It’s not my time to leave them yet.’</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN RUGBY LEAGUE</h2></p><p>“In early November, I was doing weights and I felt a little lump but thought it was nothing.</p><p>“I cracked on and eventually told my wife, who said, ‘Why don’t you get it checked out?’ I said, ‘I might do,’ and left it.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Rugby League</h2></p><p>“Eventually, an ultrasound showed it was pretty big. A CT scan followed, then they took a biopsy and I was told, ‘You’ve got melanoma under your armpit.’</p><p>“I had cancer in my lymph nodes and a surgeon said, ‘We’re going to have to operate.’”</p><p>After having all 12 lymph nodes on his right side removed, Higham was declared cancer free. Now he is undertaking at least a year of immunotherapy at Manchester’s Christie Hospital.</p><p>An infection saw fluid retained and left him ‘with like half a rugby ball under my arm.’</p><p>Now after support from figures in rugby league – pals Chris Hill, Adrian Morley and Paul Wood, former clubs, local RU side Tyldesley and the Rugby League Cares charity, particularly Steve McCormack – he wants to give back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2092250.main_image.jpg><p>Give back by breaking down the tough exterior many associate rugby league with, otherwise it could be too late.</p><p>The 42-year-old added: “I’m a little laid back and blasé. They didn’t actually describe it as cancer but my wife twigged and got really upset.</p><p>“I’ve never really felt unwell, even though people have since said I looked a little bit grey and unwell but it kicked in when I saw a MacMillan nurse. I was like, ‘S***, it’s pretty serious this.’</p><p>“When they told me I was all clear, it hit me again. I was like, ‘I did have cancer, didn’t I,’ but the support I had was brilliant.</p><p>“I treated it like, ‘I’ve had dozens of injuries and operations in my career. I’ll have another one and get better.’</p><p>“If one fella doesn’t check something or do something about it, it can be huge. It can be big or small, go to your doctor and check it out.</p><p>“Before this, I’d be like, ‘I’ll be all right, I’ve had bangs and bruises before.’ But you’ve got to look after your body. If you feel anything that doesn’t seem right, get it checked out – I did and it wasn’t good news.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/NINTCHDBPICT000814804441.jpg><p>Higham’s health scare meant a worrying Christmas for him, wife Kate and sons Harry, 18, and Alex, 13.</p><p>Kate has taken a break from her primary school teaching assistant job.</p><p>And they both know things may be very, very different. Even he admits she asked doctors and specialists questions he did not think of.</p><p>Kate told SunSport: “It was a skin cancer that must have been present on his body. It could’ve been old and because it wasn’t detected, it travelled to the lymph nodes, which caused the tumour.</p><p>“When they told us, they didn’t use the word cancer. I knew but Micky was oblivious, it still hit us like a ton of bricks though. He’s super fit, so it was a massive shock.</p><p>“The scar’s a small price to pay really. It’s bigger than ones from his career but it’s a recovery scar. It means more than one for a torn bicep or a metatarsal injury.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“If one person reads this and thinks, ‘What’s that?’ it’s a big thing. They could leave it, like Micky did.</p><p>Higham, who has not suffered side effects, even sees a positive as he quipped: “My missus said, ‘I’m sure your hair’s growing back quicker.’ A lot of people’s falls out but mine might be a blessing in disguise!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9zfpdubWxoX6fCqK7YZqOemZeqsm60xJqjraBdmK6vr8SrZKahk6DGbrTIoJ%2BapV8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nicky-hilton-reveals-mom-kathy-leaked-the-sex-of-one-of-her-babies-during-her-pregnancy-8409279.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nicky Hilton Reveals Mom Kathy Leaked Sex of Baby During Her Pregnancy">&larr;
