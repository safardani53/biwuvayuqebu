Here, <strong>Us Weekly</strong> recounts some of Remini’s most eye-opening claims.</p><p>According to Remini, only after she donated $1 million to the church, was she invited into <strong><a href=#>Tom Cruise</a></strong>’s inner circle — which supposedly didn’t include <strong>Kirstie Alley</strong> or <strong>John Travolta</strong> because Cruise “didn’t like” them, she wrote. During one get together, Remini claims that Cruise wanted to play hide-and-seek with <strong>Will Smith</strong> and<strong> Jada Pinkett Smith</strong>. At first, Remini thought Cruise was kidding. “I can’t play — I’m wearing Jimmy Choos,” she recalled in her tome. “Well, good,” Cruise allegedly replied. “So you’re it, then.” Cruise then allegedly proceeded to run around his sprawling L.A. estate while Remini opted out of the game. “Uh, Angelo [Pagan], you’re going to do ahead and do this, because I’m not doing it,” Remini said to her husband. “I’m not trying to play a f—king game of hide-and-seek in five-inch stilettos.” (Will and Jada aren’t Scientologists, just close friends of Cruise.)</p><p>Remini alleges that Cruise’s ex-girlfriend <strong>Nazanin Boniadi</strong> was secretly selected for him, but following their split, the Homeland and Scandal actress was forced to do menial labor. “I wondered if Naz had gone back to her ‘real life,’” Remini recalled after her friend went under the radar in 2004. “Years later, I found out what had happened to Naz during this time. She underwent a confidential mission for the church where she thought she was being prepared for a special humanitarian project, but ended up with the role of Tom’s girlfriend.” After being allegedly forced to undergo a series of physical transformations and to report back to the church on Cruise’s happiness during their relationship, Boniadi was dumped by Cruise via the church. After she confided in a friend, who then wrote up a report, she was punished and allegedly had to scrub toilets with a toothbrush and dig ditches.</p><p>During Cruise and Katie Holmes’ 2006 nuptials in Italy, Remini claims that Holmes left him waiting at the altar for 20 minutes. “Do you think Katie is coming?” Jennifer Lopez, whom Remini brought as a guest, allegedly asked her. During their lavish wedding, Remini also charges that Scientologist <strong>Norman Starkey</strong>, who officiated the ceremony, was spotted “humping <strong>Brooke Shields</strong> on the dance floor.”&nbsp;<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"></p><p>Remini recalled that one time Cruise supposedly got upset with an assistant over a chipped piece of china. “‘You served me tea in a chipped mug? Do you know who gets served with a mug that’s chipped? F–king DBs,'” Cruise reportedly said. (“DB” means “Degraded Being” in Scientology.) Remini also says that Cruise got upset over prepackaged cookie dough. She quotes him as telling the assistant: “‘Get in the f–king present time, is what you need to do.'”&nbsp;</p><p>In the tell-all, Remini recalled a pre-wedding dinner at Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes’ home where their then-infant daughter, <strong>Suri Cruise</strong>, was left to cry alone on the bathroom floor. Remini also states that Cruise’s older daughter, <strong>Bella</strong>, once called her mom (and ex-scientologist) <strong>Nicole Kidman</strong> <a href=#>“a f—king SP,”</a> or a “suppressed person” in church terminology.&nbsp;</p><p>After leaving the church in 2013, “I sometimes felt adrift,” Remini wrote. “But I had one figure I kept front and center in my mind to keep from going crazy: Nicole Kidman. That’s right, Tom Cruise’s ex was my guardian angel. Although I never met her or attempted to meet her, I thought about her a lot…When I was unable to sleep, I would say to myself, ‘Remember Nicole Kidman’…She was declared an SP and left the church, and she’s doing okay. Her career is still going, and she has a husband and family… Just remember Nicole Kidman. She left and she’s okay.’”<img decoding=async width=467 height=720 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Leah Remini Book" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Kidman was married to Cruise from 1990 to 2001, and Wed Country Singer Keith Urban in 2006.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Remini claimed that she had stolen food from the church’s headquarters restaurant and was later forced to pay for it. “My auditor asked me how much I thought I owed to make up the damage for the food I stole twenty years earlier,” she wrote. “‘I don’t know,’ I said. ‘How much was custard and hamburgers for three months in the eighties?’ ‘Well, let’s just round it up to $40,000. Okay?’” Remini wrote that she was dumbfounded but she paid up. In fact, she calculated that over the years she spent $2 million on training and donated $3 million.</p><p>Since the release of Remini’s book, and her just-as-revealing 20/20 interview, the Church of Scientology has vehemently denied Remini’s claims and slammed the actress as “a shallow, spoiled individual with a sense of entitlement” who “needs to move on with her life.” (<a href=#>Click here</a> to read the church’s full statement.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalnZGderOxzKKloqtdqLCqsc2tpqWnl656tbHLpWSapJxisrex0bKroaGenHq4sYyfpq6mlGK8tsCMa2dqbWRmfnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./welven-da-great.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Welven Da Great">&larr;
